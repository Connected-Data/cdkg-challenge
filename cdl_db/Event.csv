Knowledge Connexions 2020,"This visionary event featuring a rich array of technological building blocks to support the     transition to a knowledge-based economy is taking place online. The representation of the     relationships among data, information, knowledge and --ultimately-- wisdom, known as the data     pyramid, has long been part of the language of information science. Digital transformation has     made this relevant beyond the confines of information science. COVID-19 has brought years' worth     of digital transformation in just a few short months.      In this new knowledge-based digital world, encoding and making use of business and operational     knowledge is the key to making progress and staying competitive. So how do we go from data to     information, and from information to knowledge? This is the key question Knowledge Connexions     aims to address."
Connected Data World 2021,"Connected Data London, the top event for leaders and innovators on all things Knowledge Graphs,     Graph Data Science and AI, Graph Databases and Semantic Technology, is back as what it has de facto     become: Connected Data World. Building on our legacy, we are sharing a visionary outlook on Graph     as a foundational technology stack for the 2020s."
