# Knowledge Graph Challenge

The term "Graph RAG", which is a new flavour of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), has been gaining
in popularity. Its claim to fame is that it enhances RAG performance by integrating knowledge graphs,
by including structured information in an explicit form into the LLM's context prior to generating the
response. However, it's often not clear how the underlying knowledge graph is constructed from unstructured
data, and where exactly the graph is used in the pipeline for retrieval and question-answering tasks.

The aim of this repo is to provide examples of practical, demonstrable workflows on how to build a knowledge graph, query it,
and evaluate the performance of a Graph RAG application that leverages the underlying knowledge graph.
The dataset used will be the transcripts and metadata of past Connected Data World events, described
in more detail below.
