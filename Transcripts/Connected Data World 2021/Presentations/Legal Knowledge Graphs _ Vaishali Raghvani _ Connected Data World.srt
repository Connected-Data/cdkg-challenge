00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,720
Hello and welcome to our

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,820
presentation on legal
knowledge graphs.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,420
My name is Vaishali

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,495
I'm a Knowledge
Engineer at Legislate,

5
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,775
and in this presentation,

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:15,435
we will be discussing how

7
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:16,795
knowledge graphs are used in

8
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,715
the legal sector and how they

9
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:20,735
can be used with
documents in general.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,280
As we all know,

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,980
knowledge graphs
have a variety

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,900
of applications
from technology

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,400
to retail because of their

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,380
flexible nature.

15
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:30,875
And we'll be exploring how and

16
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,635
why knowledge
graphs are useful

17
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:34,415
for legal documents
and explaining

18
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:35,695
some of their use cases.

19
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,710
So a bit about legislate.

20
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,190
Now legislate is a contract

21
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,825
management platform that makes

22
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:45,525
dealing with contracts easier

23
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:46,965
for all parties involved.

24
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,505
We were founded
in twenty twenty

25
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,345
because of how
long it takes to

26
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,000
make contracts
that often aren't

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,080
very complicated
and because of

28
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,340
the pain in negotiating
contracts.

29
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
So negotiating contracts can

30
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,620
often be difficult.

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,425
It can also it can often take

32
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,285
a lot of time and
there's often

33
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:05,625
a lot of back and forth that

34
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,845
happens with this.

35
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:09,965
It also usually requires,

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
a lawyer to go
through. So sorry.

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
The documents
the contracts need

38
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,960
to go through a lawyer,

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,820
which can often
be very costly,

40
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,815
But legislator
removes the need

41
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:21,955
for us to do this.

42
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,255
We're a team of eleven based

43
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,715
between Oxford and Seville,

44
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:29,100
and we consist of
a legal, technical,

45
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,220
and sales team.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680
Our aim is to make the end to

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,885
end contracting
process as simple

48
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,045
simple as possible for anybody

49
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,665
who decides to
use the platform

50
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,185
regardless of
their background.

51
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,085
One of the things that we've

52
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,760
come across is that contracts

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,780
often contain
a lot of legalese

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,460
and can be difficult
to understand.

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,620
So we're really
trying to reduce

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,120
the amount of legalese within

57
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,625
our contracts to
make them easy

58
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,225
to understand for anybody who

59
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:54,965
reads them.

60
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:57,665
So we and we aim to make our

61
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,665
contract as usable
as we can by

62
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:02,400
using knowledge graphs to,

63
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,160
connect contracts together and

64
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
make contracts easier to deal

65
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,300
with at scale.

66
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,965
So our current
customers consist

67
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,645
of small businesses
and property

68
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,445
managements, property managers

69
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,480
or letting agents
who deal with

70
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,080
contracts on a regular basis,

71
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,260
but can't necessarily justify

72
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,400
spending huge amounts of money

73
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
on a lawyer when
a lot of their

74
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,895
contracts are
a lot of the same

75
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,735
template, but tailored towards

76
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,635
individual, properties,
or individuals.

77
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,610
So they are often
exactly the same

78
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,930
with just some key
terms being changed.

79
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,530
And paying money for this or

80
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,050
paying a large amount of money

81
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,875
for this can often
seem, unnecessary.

82
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,615
So what we're trying to do is

83
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,055
make this as easy as possible

84
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:47,715
with legislate.

85
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,820
And so a bit about me,

86
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm a knowledge
engineer at legislate.

87
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,660
I am primarily responsible for

88
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,860
dealing with knowledge graphs

89
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,560
and data
management surrounding

90
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:58,855
knowledge graphs.

91
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:00,755
So we're using
knowledge graphs

92
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,435
to organize our
data in the best

93
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,875
way possible so that we can

94
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,715
manipulate and
extract insights

95
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,980
from our data.
Knowledge graphs

96
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,900
have given us the ability to

97
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,660
navigate through
our data in a way

98
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,800
we never have before.

99
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,795
And one of the key things that

100
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,475
we've noticed is to ensure we

101
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:17,995
set up our data in the best

102
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:20,655
possible way so that it's easy

103
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:23,135
to look at, easy to
navigate through,

104
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,980
and it makes it as easy as

105
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,480
possible to get
the most out of it.

106
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,220
That's one of the main areas I

107
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,660
work work in,

108
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,035
and one of the main challenges

109
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,175
I'd say I've I've
been encountering

110
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,055
with knowledge graphs,

111
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:37,755
especially because
it's a new sector,

112
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,815
but I've really
enjoyed the process

113
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:41,035
of dealing with them.

114
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,850
So why do documents need to be

115
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,290
structured and linked?

116
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,470
So as you all know,

117
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,230
legal documents can be tedious

118
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,845
and difficult to
understand for

119
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,465
both humans and machines.

120
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,485
Generally, most
people will skim

121
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,865
through legal documents,

122
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,790
struggle to understand
the terminology.

123
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,850
They may not even
bother reading

124
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,830
the document properly.

125
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,970
And we're trying
to use knowledge

126
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,025
graphs to break down this

127
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,725
information to make it easier

128
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,925
to read for anybody
who is involved.

129
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,585
A lot of contract data is in

130
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:17,620
unstructured format and is in

131
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,820
unstructured formats,

132
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,760
and converting this
into a digital

133
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,820
computer readable
format can be

134
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,400
a challenge.

135
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:26,335
Businesses also can't always

136
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,815
rely on solely computers to do

137
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,895
this for them because
of the nature

138
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,275
of the documents,

139
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,830
because of the accuracy and

140
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,590
security of
the documents as well.

141
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,050
So for example, in,

142
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,530
in a industry
like healthcare,

143
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,155
the nature of the information

144
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,355
is often sensitive,

145
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:46,535
and you may not want you may

146
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,690
want some human
supervision over this.

147
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,090
And so using
knowledge graphs to,

148
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,410
automate this process,

149
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,750
but also have human input,

150
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,355
it really helps
make this a more

151
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,875
trustworthy process
for anybody

152
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,415
who decides to use it.

153
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:06,050
And contracts are not natively

154
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,990
machine readable,

155
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,430
which makes them difficult to

156
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,890
search and keep track of.

157
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,550
So by using knowledge graphs,

158
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,990
to organize this data,

159
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,255
we can make them
easier to follow.

160
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,115
Contracts are difficult to

161
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:20,355
understand and difficult to

162
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,015
understand in
an individual format.

163
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,620
And if we have
a hundred hundreds

164
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,760
of thousands of contracts,

165
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,020
that adds another layer of

166
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,320
complexity to this,

167
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,380
and that in itself is another

168
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,520
challenge to manage.

169
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,845
So if we can use
knowledge graphs

170
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,225
to better organize documents,

171
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,125
we can allow everybody to get

172
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,565
the most most out of their

173
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,085
documents and not worry about

174
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,625
what they're getting
themselves into.

175
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,540
So over here, we
just have a a little

176
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,680
diagram showing you
what the problems

177
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,840
with, documents can be.

178
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,465
So if we have one contract,

179
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,265
this is easy to,

180
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,485
this is easy to
process for a trained

181
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,540
human. So, generally,

182
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,320
somebody in the legal sector.

183
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
If we have a few,

184
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
this is manageable
for a trained human,

185
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,600
so somebody from
the legal sector.

186
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:12,765
But if we have
hundreds of them,

187
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:15,245
this is difficult
for even a somebody

188
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:16,365
from the legal sector.

189
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:20,220
It's, having a knowledge graph

190
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,820
to help make this
process easier,

191
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,960
makes it more manageable,

192
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,300
and makes it easy for anybody

193
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,195
to understand, not
just necessarily

194
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:29,555
a trained human.

195
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:35,850
So why should you structure

196
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,770
documents with
knowledge graphs?

197
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,550
So contracts contain highly

198
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,530
connected information,

199
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,095
and knowledge graphs can make

200
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:44,855
them easier to
process and search

201
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:45,515
at scale.

202
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,995
So contracts can
contain connected

203
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,655
fields. And as we all know,

204
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,920
knowledge graphs are flexible

205
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,520
and allow you to make links,

206
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,220
between nodes. So
using knowledge

207
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,900
graphs, we can
organize contracts

208
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,535
in a digestible and easy to

209
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,775
follow format and
use this data

210
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:06,315
in a variety of ways.

211
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:07,435
So, essentially,

212
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:08,935
knowledge graphs allow us to

213
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:12,280
organize contracts and break

214
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,040
them down into smaller chunks

215
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,560
that anybody can
understand and

216
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,420
use it in a variety of ways.

217
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,740
So over here, we
have an example

218
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,715
of a employment
offer letter and

219
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:23,935
an employment agreement.

220
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,315
So when you hire somebody,

221
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,475
you'd often be issuing
them an employment

222
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,740
offer letter and
an and an employment

223
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,220
agreement. But a lot of these

224
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,140
fields will be
exactly the same

225
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,915
across both
contracts or across

226
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,055
both legal documents.

227
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,075
The job title would
be the same.

228
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:43,535
The salary would be the same.

229
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,290
The line manager
would be the same.

230
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,170
And instead of having
to copy this over,

231
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,810
we could essentially just link

232
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,725
these two documents and copy

233
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:54,805
the fields over by
using knowledge

234
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:55,305
graphs.

235
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,045
So this is another diagram of

236
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,185
how we can link documents.

237
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,270
As I was saying,

238
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,870
when you hire an employee,

239
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,390
you will often issue an offer

240
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,970
letter and a employment
agreement.

241
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:13,265
And instead of
having two separate

242
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,105
documents that aren't linked,

243
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,525
we can use a graph,

244
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,545
which is natively
machine readable

245
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:19,970
and understandable.

246
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,870
It's also easy to search and

247
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,970
query to link
these documents.

248
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,430
So let's say this was our

249
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,490
employment agreement,

250
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:29,735
and this was our
employment agreement,

251
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,195
and this was our
offer letter.

252
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:33,975
Now these fields
might be the same.

253
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,075
So this might be
the salary field.

254
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,460
This might be the job title,

255
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,540
and this might be
the line manager.

256
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,000
We can then create
links between

257
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,265
these two contracts
because they

258
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,885
will contain the same
information.

259
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,245
And by linking them,

260
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,645
we make them easier
to search and query.

261
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,025
It's easier for an employer to

262
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,640
keep track of all
their employment

263
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
contracts and
keep track of all

264
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,180
their employment,

265
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,960
letters or contracts with with

266
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,855
a specific person and makes it

267
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,795
easier for them to
keep track of.

268
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,010
So reasoning is something that

269
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,610
also allows us to,

270
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,330
add more information into our

271
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,270
database and enrich our data.

272
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,855
So legal documents are
bound by the law,

273
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:22,615
and, hence, they
have rules they

274
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:24,475
need to follow in order
to be compliant.

275
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,375
This is where rule
based reasoning

276
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,895
can be useful
because we can use

277
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:30,390
it to validate contract data.

278
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,750
So legal documents,

279
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,550
may will have clauses,

280
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,695
and by using rule
based reasoning,

281
00:09:36,755 --> 00:09:38,675
we can validate
the clauses that

282
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,995
are within
a document or ensure

283
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,535
that clauses are
written correctly

284
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,055
by using rule
based reasoning.

285
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,310
Rule based reasoning generally

286
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,130
uses an if then format,

287
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,410
whereby if the condition of

288
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,450
the rule is met,

289
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,810
then the latter
part of the rule

290
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,190
can be applied
to the dataset,

291
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,635
which can help us validate

292
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:57,875
contract data because we can

293
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,715
validate certain fields within

294
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,395
a contract. So
in an employment

295
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,910
agreement, we can
validate that

296
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,110
the salary field was there,

297
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,730
the job title
field was there,

298
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,510
benefits, and
insurance details

299
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,830
were there. We can also use

300
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,955
reasoning to connect contracts

301
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:14,415
as we've previously discussed

302
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,335
and infer new relationships

303
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,155
based on
the information available

304
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:18,895
to us.

305
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,110
Querying, as you all know,

306
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,870
is traditionally the way in

307
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,750
which you interact
with a knowledge

308
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,205
graph. So with reasoning,

309
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,585
querying then becomes really

310
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,345
insightful to us
because we can

311
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:37,160
use rules to
determine a lot to

312
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,780
predetermine a lot
of the information

313
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
that is tied to
our documents.

314
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,680
As you all know,

315
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,540
querying generally
uses sparkle

316
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,925
to interact with
the data store.

317
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:50,225
And based from based
off reasoning,

318
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:52,045
we can use sparkle to interact

319
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:53,725
with our data
store and the new

320
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:55,890
insights from rule
based reasoning.

321
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,870
One of the other things that I

322
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,630
think is quite
useful with rule

323
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,030
based reasoning
is it allows you

324
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,185
to act with the benefit
of hindsight.

325
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,005
So if you have access to your

326
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,165
data store, you
can look at all

327
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:09,685
the information
you have available

328
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,205
to you and, like I said,

329
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,185
enrich your data,

330
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,940
with further
relationships because

331
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,380
you now know what
you're dealing with,

332
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,220
and you can add
more relationships

333
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,080
into the data to
make it intuitive

334
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,960
to understand.

335
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,015
I also personally think that

336
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,295
sparkle and queries
are an intuitive

337
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,375
method of interacting
with data.

338
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,390
You're looking
for patterns and

339
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,330
relationships and
matching them up.

340
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,470
So using queries to interact

341
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,310
with your database can be easy

342
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,090
to pick up and easy
to understand,

343
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,745
which is something
I found as well,

344
00:11:42,145 --> 00:11:43,425
when I first started working

345
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,725
with Agistay and working
with Monograph,

346
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:48,705
because I found the pattern

347
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:51,090
nature really easy
to follow and

348
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,310
easy to pick up.

349
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,770
And now we're gonna go through

350
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,035
some use cases of
using knowledge

351
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,995
graphs, in the legal
sector and

352
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:05,515
giving you some
examples of how

353
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,735
exactly this can work.

354
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,930
So we'll start with an easy

355
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,170
example and then work
our oh, whoops.

356
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,590
Sorry. And and then
work our way up.

357
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,555
So one of the easiest ways is

358
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,735
to ask questions and
retrieve answers.

359
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,275
And we can do this simply by

360
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,575
querying our database.

361
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,595
So it can be as
simple as asking

362
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,010
your database how many of our

363
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,710
contracts are
employment agreements.

364
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,790
And as I was saying previously

365
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,050
how we can add,

366
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,095
we can enrich our data with

367
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,395
the benefit of hindsight.

368
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,875
Here, we're asking
our database

369
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:38,375
how many contracts
are employment

370
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,295
agreements, but
we've added this

371
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:41,930
employment agreement class by

372
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,210
looking at all the contracts

373
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,830
that we have in our data store

374
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,370
and adding in further rules to

375
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,190
create classes and
enrich our data.

376
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:52,915
And although this can be done

377
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,135
by other databases,

378
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,035
this is a lot quicker with

379
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:56,915
knowledge graphs,

380
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:58,935
and we can use
the reasoning to

381
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,000
help clear up some
information.

382
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,620
We can also use queries to

383
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,680
calculate metrics.

384
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,685
So like like I've just said,

385
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,905
you can calculate
metrics using

386
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:12,805
other databases,

387
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:18,610
but we can make
this a lot quicker

388
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,130
with knowledge graphs,

389
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,670
and we can also provide users

390
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,970
with tailored metrics,

391
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:26,345
that are specific to them.

392
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,685
So this metric is
looking through

393
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,865
the database to
find all the active

394
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,705
teams within team two.

395
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,830
So it's looking for
all the contracts

396
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,510
that are a part of team two,

397
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,930
and then it's looking
for the start

398
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,790
and end dates attached
to the contract

399
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,115
and filtering for if the end

400
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,875
date is after
the date and time

401
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,795
right now and if
the start date

402
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,735
is before the date
and time right now.

403
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,330
We also have an optional field

404
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,130
for the end date.

405
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,050
So for a contract
like an employment

406
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,390
agreement, that may
not necessarily

407
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,705
have an end date
because an employee

408
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,405
can choose when they
wish to leave.

409
00:14:02,505 --> 00:14:03,885
The end date is optional.

410
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,045
And so if the end
date isn't bound,

411
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,680
we just look for if the start

412
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
date is before
the date and time

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,160
right now. So that's
just a little

414
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,840
breakdown of what
this query is doing,

415
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,275
but then we can
then append this

416
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,115
information to
a metric and use

417
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,495
it wherever we like.

418
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,035
Building upon this,

419
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,940
we can also use
knowledge graphs

420
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,420
to provide users with contract

421
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,320
specific metrics.

422
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,860
So provide them with metrics

423
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,080
that are tailored to,

424
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,625
their contracts or to their

425
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,225
their dataset,
and this doesn't

426
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,905
necessarily have to
be an employment

427
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:38,685
metric. It can be
a property metric.

428
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,650
It can be a business
metric and

429
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,910
look at NDAs and
the average term.

430
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,130
This is just an example that

431
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,190
I've picked out.

432
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,225
So this metric is
for a given team,

433
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,085
it's looking for
the total salary

434
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:52,985
based on all
the contracts within

435
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:55,165
that team that
somebody has created.

436
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,580
And we can also
build a histogram

437
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,000
that automatically arranges

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
itself based on the values of

439
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,655
the contracts. So say we were

440
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:05,415
to hire another
team member who

441
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:08,475
has a salary of eighty
thousand pounds,

442
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,795
this histogram
will automatically

443
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:11,835
arrange itself,

444
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,180
to not only include
include them

445
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,220
in the in the distribution and

446
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,820
post very likely at the end of

447
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,665
this distribution, But,

448
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,725
this this distribution
here will

449
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,025
also rearrange itself,

450
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,420
to organize the data based on

451
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,520
the information
in the data set.

452
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,940
So it will work out the median

453
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,355
and the quartiles accordingly

454
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,795
based on the contracts within

455
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:41,735
the database, and,

456
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,295
it will re rearrange
itself accordingly,

457
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,195
which is really handy and just

458
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,310
makes sure that this this

459
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,150
information is
tailored to a user

460
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,310
and gives them all the insight

461
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,210
that they require.

462
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,025
As we've discussed
previously,

463
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,185
we can also use contracts to

464
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,025
validate contract structures,

465
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,485
and verify that contract

466
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,025
configurations are compliant,

467
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,390
with logical, legal,

468
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,490
and user defined
compliance rules.

469
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,190
So an employment
agreement, for example,

470
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,790
in order to be classified as

471
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,930
an employment agreement,

472
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,965
would need to
contain a salary,

473
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,125
a job title, a work location,

474
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,365
and a restriction period.

475
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,685
These are just some
examples of fields.

476
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,400
They can contain
more or less,

477
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,920
but these are some
of the fields

478
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,400
that would define the contract

479
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,700
to be an employment
agreement.

480
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:32,415
And this is important because

481
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:34,335
the employee needs
to know their

482
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:36,515
necessary obligations
as an employee,

483
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,235
and the employer is obligated

484
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,930
to provide them with
this information.

485
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,290
Using knowledge graphs
and reasoning,

486
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,130
we can verify if a particular

487
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,595
contract's if sorry.

488
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,655
Using knowledge graphs
and reasoning,

489
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,355
we can verify if a particular

490
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:53,955
contract should
have particular

491
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,740
clauses depending on the type

492
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,700
of contract it is,

493
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,100
and we can we can say whether

494
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,700
they should be
included or whether

495
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,680
they shouldn't be.

496
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,705
One of the last
use cases we can

497
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,705
have for knowledge graphs are

498
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:09,525
smart folders.

499
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,870
So using we can
further classify

500
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,190
our contracts by
using smart folders,

501
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:18,605
that automatically filter

502
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,405
contracts based
on active data.

503
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,305
So they'll filter through

504
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:25,680
documents by looking
at the information

505
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,340
inside them and,

506
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,080
organizing contracts
into folders

507
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,545
accordingly. So
they look through

508
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,145
your data and
they look for key

509
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,825
information and
they can filter

510
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,105
by a start date,

511
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:39,645
a particular line manager,

512
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,510
by contracts with
a specific individual,

513
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,810
by looking at contracts within

514
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,690
a specific year,

515
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,710
or by look by a group
of contracts,

516
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:54,005
with a company as
a specific party.

517
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,865
So it will look at the entries

518
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:58,465
of a contract and then make

519
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,100
these groupings accordingly.

520
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,480
It can connect contracts,

521
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,920
and it can draw insights that

522
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,925
would be time consuming to do

523
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,085
on our own without the use of

524
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,005
a knowledge graph
or rule based

525
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,805
reasoning. To do
this manually,

526
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,200
you'd have to look
at the contract

527
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,480
terms, analyze them,

528
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,540
and link them manually.

529
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,440
And using knowledge graphs,

530
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
this completely
removes the need

531
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,780
to do that.

532
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:26,245
So we've spoken about
some use cases,

533
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,265
and we're gonna
dive into another

534
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,545
example of how we can use

535
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:31,445
knowledge graphs,

536
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,580
which is by visualizing
contracts.

537
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
We've also spoken about how

538
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,560
contracts can be difficult to

539
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,240
understand and
difficult to read

540
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,885
through. And so once you have

541
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,885
access to the fields
of a contract

542
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,025
in a knowledge graph,

543
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,765
we can derive insights from

544
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,370
contract data to make it it

545
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,830
accessible to non lawyers.

546
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,370
And one of the ways we can do

547
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,730
that is to make the contract

548
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,410
more visual or to just simply

549
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,930
make the contract easier to

550
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,295
understand by presenting
the information

551
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,655
in another way.

552
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,375
So by storing the information

553
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:09,160
in a contract by its specific

554
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,220
contract fields,

555
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,700
we can easily access
the information

556
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,360
in these fields and use it in

557
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,340
multiple areas.

558
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:17,815
One of the examples of this is

559
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:19,495
that letting agents will often

560
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:20,475
provide their,

561
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,380
student let lets with a a key

562
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,160
information sheet that will be

563
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,320
provided based on
each individual

564
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,220
contract and tailored based on

565
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,600
each individual contract.

566
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:34,765
It might have
the key information

567
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,265
that student will
need to know,

568
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:38,285
such as when the rent is due,

569
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:39,950
how much late fees are,

570
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,050
how much notice is
given for reviewing.

571
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,430
And this could be
done via a template

572
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,870
that a letting agent may have

573
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,550
where they just simply replace

574
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,155
the information by
looking through

575
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,955
the the linked contract and

576
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,315
adding this information into

577
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,610
the template. But, again,

578
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,130
this would have to be edited

579
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,390
according to each
individual contract.

580
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,290
And using knowledge graphs,

581
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,950
we can make this
process a lot easier.

582
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,835
So using knowledge
graphs and reasoning,

583
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:12,715
we can derive this information

584
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,315
using domain expertise.

585
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,410
We can use reasoning to access

586
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,090
the information depending on

587
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,270
the type of field it's
being stored in.

588
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,490
So, basically, if we know what

589
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,835
type of contract
field a field is,

590
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:27,615
such as if it's
a salary field,

591
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:29,215
we can access the information

592
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,715
in this field, which will be

593
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:34,370
the entry to for
the salary, and,

594
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,590
use this in a variety
of formats,

595
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,870
either by visualization,

596
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,415
so by showing it
in a more visual

597
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:42,955
manner, or simply,

598
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:46,475
showing it in a partially
visual manner,

599
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,875
but a easy to
understand manner.

600
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,970
So that instead of
looking through

601
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,870
the whole contract,

602
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,170
a individual can just look at

603
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,070
the key summary,

604
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:01,625
the key summary fields and get

605
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,145
exact get the information that

606
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:03,805
they need.

607
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,700
And, yeah, this
can be presented

608
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,980
in any way, that
a user decides.

609
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,420
So this is just an example of

610
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,560
us showing you that,

611
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,435
we've got this information for

612
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,395
my knowledge graph.

613
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:17,255
This could be a string that is

614
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:19,475
just stored, and
then this value

615
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:21,350
is filled is sorry.

616
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,510
This value is
filled with the,

617
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,750
value from the contract.

618
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,070
And this is what will change,

619
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,310
according to each
individual contract.

620
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,725
And this is made a lot easier

621
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,925
using knowledge graphs,

622
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:35,685
because it can just look for

623
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,105
the the fields stored
within a contract

624
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:39,305
and change it accordingly,

625
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
which again ties
in with our aim

626
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,500
to make contracts
easier to understand,

627
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,600
and easy for anybody to deal

628
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,540
with no matter what
their background is.

629
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:53,845
So as we've discussed,

630
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:55,505
knowledge graphs have a number

631
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:57,745
of different
practical and helpful

632
00:21:57,745 --> 00:21:59,365
uses in the legal sector,

633
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,290
and we've hope we've been able

634
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,730
we hope we've
been able to shed

635
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,710
some light on this.

636
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,490
It allows us to
extract insights

637
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,270
and information from
legal documents.

638
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:10,335
We can use rule
based reasoning

639
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:12,835
to infer new
relation relationships

640
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,475
or simply build
more relationships

641
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,215
into the graph
and make our data

642
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:18,035
more insightful.

643
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,560
Using rule based reasoning,

644
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,980
we can also get more
useful queries,

645
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,225
and interact with our data in

646
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:29,065
a more useful manner and find

647
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:31,005
exactly what it is
we're looking for.

648
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,640
Knowledge graphs
have the ability

649
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,100
to unlock so much
information,

650
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,580
and we've only just
touched on it.

651
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,160
But we hope to continue our

652
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,680
research and
explore this field

653
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
so that we can
make the best use

654
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,895
of them and really show what

655
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:46,095
knowledge graphs can do,

656
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:48,435
and what the what
their potential is.

657
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:50,871
Thank you for your time.

658
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,151
And if you have
any questions,

659
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:53,611
I'll be happy to take them.
