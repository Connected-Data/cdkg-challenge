1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,340
Good morning. Good afternoon.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,380
Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,500
Welcome to the talk,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,165
Applying Semantic
Web Standards

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:12,605
for Knowledge
Representation at

6
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:14,765
Elsevier. I'm Veronique Moore,

7
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,465
Manager of
Taxonomy Development

8
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,125
and the slide
deck was prepared

9
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,405
together with Anna Tordai,

10
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:21,150
who is Senior
Architect also at

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,370
Elsevier. The outline will be

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,830
quite short. First,

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,350
I'll walk you through a bird's

14
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,695
eye view what Elsevier is,

15
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,035
from publisher to technology

16
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:33,535
organizations, so what we used

17
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:35,075
to do and what we
are doing now,

18
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,695
which will lead
to the question,

19
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:39,635
why do we need linked
data standards?

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,460
And then more importantly,

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,960
what are we doing?

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,740
We'll link data at Elsevier.

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
I'll start at
the global level,

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,460
and then we'll
do a deeper down

25
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,905
presentation of how we use it

26
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:53,205
for managing vocabularies.

27
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,085
So Elsevier,

28
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:58,750
maybe you know us
as a publishing

29
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,810
company, and that
is still true.

30
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,410
As in two thousand eighteen,

31
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,930
we were still publishing four

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,455
hundred seventy
thousand articles,

33
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:08,455
throughout the whole year.

34
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:10,775
But even so, if
we're publishing

35
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:12,915
articles, we're adding, data.

36
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,400
We're adding value to it.

37
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,340
For example,
the United Nations,

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,740
sustainable development goals

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,085
classification.
So the articles

40
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,625
are tagged, with these
different goals,

41
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,565
so you can see
which articles,

42
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,485
which research contributes to

43
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,005
sustainable developments.

44
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,160
The, funding references,

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,400
that are also in the articles

46
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,580
are tagged also.

47
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,845
So a funding body can,

48
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:42,605
look how many articles were

49
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:45,425
published based on
a a specific grant,

50
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:47,085
and we add other values.

51
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,620
So publishing, yes, but,

52
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,680
doing data analytics
on top of it.

53
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,760
Elsevier is a global company

54
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,655
with seven thousand
nine hundred

55
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,395
employees all over the world.

56
00:01:58,715 --> 00:01:59,995
Yeah, people in my team are

57
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,935
working from Australia,
for example.

58
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,880
And our CEO is comes
out by asset.

59
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,540
So eighty three percent of our

60
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,060
revenues right now comes from

61
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,200
digital products.

62
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,145
In a nutshell, who are we?

63
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,985
We are global information

64
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,005
analytics business,

65
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:19,105
and we help scientists,
researchers,

66
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,810
students, doctors,
nurses, engineers,

67
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,630
a wide range of customers find

68
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,775
actual answers to their most

69
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,755
critical needs.

70
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:36,475
And, one aspect in
which we helped out,

71
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:40,720
the past global
pandemic was to build,

72
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,960
a coronavirus research hub,

73
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,360
where we helped
out researchers,

74
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,945
get quick and
targeted access to,

75
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:51,585
every research
that we could tag

76
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,445
that was relevant
for coronavirus

77
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,120
in terms of impact,

78
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,640
or in terms of research.

79
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,995
And this was
declined in a whole

80
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:04,675
set of tools that
we provide at

81
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:06,935
Elsevier. Mendeley,

82
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:09,015
you might be aware
of for managing

83
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,255
your bibliographical records,

84
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,550
but it also provides
recommenders.

85
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,710
So Mendeley data had a special

86
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,470
COVID nineteen feature.

87
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,575
Scopus and ScienceDirect
are a publishing

88
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,835
platform, so, you could be

89
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:27,495
accessing the COVID nineteen

90
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:29,595
relevant parts of
these huge platforms.

91
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,120
HyAxis, for example,

92
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,920
is a tool that is targeting on

93
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,900
chemical reactions.

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,480
So if your domain is chemistry

95
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,020
and you were interested in

96
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,215
research around COVID nineteen

97
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,115
within chemical reactions,

98
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,475
you could access this spot.

99
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,075
So that was into the,

100
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,855
coronavirus researcher.

101
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,390
The hub now is still available

102
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,770
and the papers that were made

103
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,710
publicly accessible via this

104
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,835
specific hub are
still accessible

105
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:02,600
for research. So
Elsevierian numbers.

106
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,120
I'm not gonna go through all

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,560
these numbers, but this gives

108
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,660
you an idea of
the volume of data,

109
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
information, documents that

110
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,380
we're dealing with.

111
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,805
And, you can also see some of

112
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,805
the different products that

113
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,585
we're providing.

114
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,905
So Sharepath is for
nursing education.

115
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,520
It's, a recommended
system that helps,

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,140
nurses get into
their journey for,

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,575
training and getting their,

118
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,975
how do you call it,
certificates.

119
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:40,655
Clinical key, serves
medical doctors,

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,120
provides them
access to clinical

121
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
overviews and
actual answers to

122
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,540
questions they might have when

123
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,520
facing a patient.

124
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,765
So it's not only static data,

125
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:52,305
but it's a lot of dynamic and

126
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:53,985
on the spot data that,

127
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:56,725
we also deliver
through our products.

128
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,910
And what is the big challenge

129
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,270
in research? What is the big

130
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,570
challenge for our customers?

131
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,010
What do they need?
They need data.

132
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,825
And one of the big pain points

133
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,985
is around data
preparation, of course.

134
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,045
It's time consuming,

135
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:13,405
computationally heavy.

136
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,410
We have lots of data,

137
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,070
and data is coming in
every single day.

138
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,850
It's repetitive.
It's not fun.

139
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,875
Yeah. But it has to be done.

140
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,555
It's like, bunny
tight, like, yeah,

141
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,835
loving you is a dirty job,

142
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,455
but someone's got to do it.

143
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,535
And it is brittle,

144
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,130
if it's done in
an ad hoc manner.

145
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,450
What we need then,

146
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,045
is to have pipelines that get

147
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,825
data through
standard processes,

148
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,225
but that convert
it into a format

149
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:47,245
that is,

150
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,485
easily curable because it's

151
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,520
understand that it's
understood by,

152
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,100
the wide set of
tools at Elsevier

153
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,700
of our data platforms.

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,020
What we need is
standardization.

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,565
What we need is link data.

156
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,865
The same same problem, and,

157
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:06,705
then we can hop on to the,

158
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,625
great design model
that the link

159
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,330
data provides,
because here too,

160
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,050
there's, enormous number of

161
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,210
datasets that appear every day

162
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,415
that were created by
different people,

163
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:20,475
by different organizations.

164
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:23,735
They talk about different type

165
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:25,415
of datasets. They
serve different

166
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:27,260
purposes, but
they're all linked.

167
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,540
They're they're
referenceable.

168
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,920
They are standardized,
and thus,

169
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,160
they can be interoperable and

170
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,325
standard QA. So
quality assurance

171
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,085
tools can be applied
throughout.

172
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,625
And pipelines can be designed

173
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,265
to fit the global
unified model

174
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:43,245
instead of having,

175
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:54,305
a processing So

176
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,125
for that,

177
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:58,725
the architecture team
where Anatolia is,

178
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:01,345
designed the Elsevier Linked

179
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,220
Data Standard,
which is a place

180
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,400
where you can find
references to,

181
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,460
existing w three c,

182
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,760
so World War Web Consortium,

183
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,640
recommendations
that we're using.

184
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:14,585
It defines when we're using

185
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:18,425
the recommendations
as is and when,

186
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:20,965
some specific model has been

187
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:23,550
extended for our
needs, because yeah.

188
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,990
You'll see in the next slide.

189
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,670
First, we start
with the w three

190
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,330
c models.

191
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,810
So we're using a shackle,

192
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,505
and it's a huge
expressive power,

193
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:38,245
for restricting
and helping out

194
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:40,480
auto populating some
of the metadata

195
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,080
around the vocabularies.

196
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,380
In the management system,

197
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,100
we use PROV and PAV to define

198
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,565
the provenance of data,

199
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:52,745
that we have there.

200
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:55,065
So entities, it can
be the provenance

201
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:55,965
of a vocabulary,

202
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,465
a provenance of a paper,

203
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:59,270
a provenance of
a given concept

204
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,650
in a specific graph.

205
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,470
So we can go at all sorts of

206
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,350
different levels.

207
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,790
But because we're
using standard

208
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,730
vocabularies, the semantics is

209
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:08,915
defined in a standard way,

210
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:10,835
and we can also interact with

211
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,375
vocabularies that are external

212
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:13,955
datasets that are external,

213
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,155
and we know that they will be

214
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,470
compatible because they use

215
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,350
the same semantics.

216
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,950
Vocabularies that I mentioned

217
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,090
once or twice already,

218
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,870
are designed in Scos and more

219
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,615
specifically in SCOS Excel.

220
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:27,975
And the annotations,

221
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,755
that we produce follow the web

222
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,215
annotation data model.

223
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,880
So we're compatible
and data can

224
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,460
be used,

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,320
by people who use
other linked data.

226
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,340
We can use other linked data,

227
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,675
and this way we can interact

228
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:46,175
with the latest
progress in science.

229
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,210
Because we have lots of very

230
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,230
specific types of data,

231
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,025
Elsevier has
designed an Elsevier

232
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:01,205
data model to be
able to express

233
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,845
information and relationships

234
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,225
for these different
types of entities.

235
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:09,330
So here you see
a quick snapshot,

236
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,710
around reactions that would be

237
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,010
for tools like reaccess,

238
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,210
clinical trials,
treatments, diseases,

239
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:19,495
because, yeah,
Elsevier focuses

240
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,895
a lot on the health
side of things,

241
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,195
your drugs, patients.

242
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,370
But there's also
another side,

243
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,950
which is, represented
by funders,

244
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,710
researchers, research
institutions.

245
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,505
So researchers and funding

246
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,525
institutions are
part of the people,

247
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,725
we need to express
information for,

248
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,210
because they're interested in

249
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,810
outcomes of what has
been published.

250
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,330
So that's part of metadata we

251
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,190
add using standards.

252
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:48,615
And a side that's not present

253
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:49,735
in this slide is everything

254
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,675
related to engineering and

255
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:53,515
sustainable development,

256
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:57,350
renewable energy,
which is a big,

257
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,710
growing facet.

258
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,670
We have Vocabrio's
ecosystem to support,

259
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,555
these different products to

260
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:07,935
support our customers,

261
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,195
and we have a dozen vocabulary

262
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,795
management teams
across the globe.

263
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:16,770
They are not all, yeah.

264
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,690
It's not just one
big team that

265
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,850
serves everybody
across the globe,

266
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,530
but we have
different teams that

267
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,325
are spread up.

268
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:25,565
And the way to,

269
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,885
be able to interact and share

270
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:30,605
not only vocabularies,
sources,

271
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:33,450
but also processes is to have

272
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,290
a link data again and follow

273
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,350
the same standards.

274
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,230
So we follow the Elsevier
data model,

275
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,935
which is linked
to international

276
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,395
IDF standards. And that way,

277
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,635
we can grow our
data but benefit

278
00:10:46,635 --> 00:10:47,930
from each other also.

279
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,490
So, we have two big
knowledge graphs.

280
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,050
We have thirty
vocabularies and,

281
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,270
of course, these vocabularies

282
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,270
have some overlap
and, of course,

283
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:58,405
some new products, projects,

284
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,105
proof of concepts,
development need,

285
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,965
new vocabularies to
be built quickly.

286
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:06,430
And, because we link them and

287
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,270
we use the same semantics and

288
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,810
properties across them,

289
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,890
then we can spin off, yeah,

290
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,275
some quick vocabulary
or subgraph

291
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,655
or branches based on what we

292
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,755
already have and
can share across

293
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:21,475
the globe.

294
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,260
The use cases
that we serve are

295
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,040
quite varied. It's basically

296
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,880
anything you can do
with the vocabulary.

297
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,415
So browsing, autocomplete in

298
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:32,955
Mendeley data, for example.

299
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,755
Recommender in
ScienceDirect, Mendeley.

300
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:40,520
Classification, I
was mentioning the,

301
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,220
United Nation
sustainable goals

302
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,360
classification. There's also

303
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,260
topic classification.

304
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,535
We do annotation and search.

305
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,635
And I will, talk more about

306
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,155
annotation in
a minute when I'll

307
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:58,760
show you an actual
tool and, yeah,

308
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,700
an actual product
that we produce,

309
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,080
which is the ScienceDirect
topic pages.

310
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
So we have time for it,

311
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,420
a little spotlight.

312
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,105
What is a topic page?

313
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,905
A topic page is,

314
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:14,745
some sort of like a Wikipedia

315
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,950
if you want but for
scientific concepts.

316
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,910
The idea is to
give a researcher

317
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,650
who doesn't know
much about one

318
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,345
specific notion
a definition if

319
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,325
we have it,

320
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,205
related concepts
or some sort of,

321
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:34,020
yeah, cloud of related notions

322
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,920
and relevant snippets from our

323
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,860
content so that
they could grasp

324
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
what this notion is about and

325
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,685
get resources to
do a deep dive

326
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,145
from there if
they're interested

327
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:47,605
in learning more.

328
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:48,945
So, for example,

329
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,990
you can access it using
a Google search.

330
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,610
So what is
the cosine similarity

331
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,830
distance in NLP gives you as

332
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,070
first results,
topic page or at

333
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,750
least did at the time of this

334
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,555
screenshot. Not certain it's

335
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:01,375
still the case.

336
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,495
From our content,
from ScienceDirect,

337
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,780
when you get an article,

338
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,980
there's some annotation
that happened,

339
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
and, the hyperlink
redirects you

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,125
to the topic page.

341
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,425
This is what it looks like.

342
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,965
So here a definition
would appear

343
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,405
if it would have
one for cosine

344
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:26,890
similarity. And
as you can see,

345
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,250
the process is still
a work in progress.

346
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,010
So, we do try to populate

347
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:37,385
definitions for as
many pages as we can,

348
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:40,125
and we are investigating
more resources,

349
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,305
yeah, and more
sources for filling

350
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,045
them in.

351
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,550
There's a set of
related terms,

352
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,390
and here are the snippets
I mentioned.

353
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,990
So if you go down the page,

354
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,495
you get book chapters
that you can read,

355
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:56,055
that gives you
some information

356
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,955
about what cosine
similarity is,

357
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:58,900
what its use,

358
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,820
and there is a feedback box.

359
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,540
So for example,

360
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,980
here the feedback could be,

361
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,880
there's no definition.

362
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,020
I don't need a topic page if

363
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,900
there's no definition.

364
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,675
So that's good feedback for us

365
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,235
to be spotting what
are the critical

366
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,255
places where we
would need to,

367
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,055
add data or information.

368
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,340
In the back end,
how does it work?

369
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,700
Well, it works based on linked

370
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,240
data because we need to,

371
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,440
have a taxonomy,

372
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:25,995
annotating all of
science direct

373
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,995
publications, but also book

374
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,415
publication and all sorts of

375
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:32,175
other tools. We also integrate

376
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:34,470
with high access reactions.

377
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,750
So on some topic pages,

378
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,370
you can see reactions.

379
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,770
We integrate with
clinical key,

380
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,615
to have
medical recommendations

381
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,135
also show up in topic pages.

382
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,195
So there's an interaction,

383
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,455
for a whole range of document

384
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:53,260
type that used to be serving

385
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,300
different products.

386
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,460
So if you keep
all the documents

387
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,180
separate in the way
they're processed,

388
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,785
if you keep all the documents

389
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,265
targeted to one
single product,

390
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:05,285
then you cannot build
such an aggregation

391
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,865
. So there is data mining from

392
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:10,770
different sources that are

393
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,750
aggregated using
relevancy ranking

394
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,930
to get the, topic page
having the most,

395
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,390
useful information,

396
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,355
focusing on entry
point information,

397
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,355
about a given topic.

398
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:25,895
And then there are
automated scripts,

399
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,475
but also a thorough SME review

400
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:32,060
of the topic pages
after every release.

401
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,420
There's sorry.

402
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,655
There's a quarterly release,

403
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:41,415
of topic pages.

404
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,155
So, four times a year,

405
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,995
you get a new set
of topics that

406
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:45,655
are published.

407
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,340
And the topic pages are using

408
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,900
OmniSciences as a source
for annotation.

409
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,035
The OmniSciences
is a Scos Excel

410
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:00,475
vocabulary that was started in

411
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:01,535
two thousand fourteen.

412
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:05,320
Its first, use case, like,

413
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,440
its first goal,

414
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,200
was to link the different

415
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
standards that we were already

416
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,520
using for annotating
content at

417
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,485
Elsevier and, that
needed harmonization,

418
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,645
but also to be able to do,

419
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:20,125
cross platform m and gams.

420
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,020
So we created,

421
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,040
we created
Omniscience for that

422
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
first purpose, but we didn't

423
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,835
base it on
the Elsevier standards

424
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,375
themselves. We build
it on linked data.

425
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,275
So we used,

426
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,955
DBpedia anthologies to see how

427
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,850
the international community in

428
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,090
research was
representing the world

429
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,430
of research. We use
some principles

430
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,085
as atomization of concepts,

431
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,425
so that we could link out two

432
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,865
vocabularies that regroup some

433
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,225
entities in different ways.

434
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,125
So for example,

435
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,850
if Elsevier were
classifying, articles,

436
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,690
in agriculture and agrobiology

437
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,705
and food sciences
as one topic.

438
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,445
We were creating
three different

439
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,125
topics to link out to these

440
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,885
because other
vocabularies might

441
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:17,060
regroup fisheries
together with,

442
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,900
other concepts.

443
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,400
So we didn't want
to be relying

444
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,680
on one specific grouping,

445
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,140
but we wanted to have,

446
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:25,965
only atomic entries that we

447
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,525
could link out for making end

448
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,665
to end crosswalks.

449
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,510
As I said it's
using ScosXcels.

450
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,350
ScosXcel also for mappings.

451
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,765
We keep external
unique identifiers

452
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:41,985
to be able to get back
to the references

453
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:44,385
, and we use provenance and,

454
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:48,900
DCT source information to link

455
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,560
our vocabularies and and keep

456
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,240
in our vocabularies as much

457
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,920
metadata as possible that we

458
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,420
could use for either
making a subset

459
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,545
based on copyrights,
of course,

460
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,985
or, yeah, making crosswalks

461
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,170
between two specific
resources.

462
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,370
So Omniscience was
created as a bridge,

463
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,890
and then it expanded.

464
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,355
We needed one single single

465
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:16,495
vocabulary for,

466
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:18,795
the paper submission system,

467
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,415
which at time was revised.

468
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,715
And so we added to,

469
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:24,790
the top levels that
we had created

470
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,670
using only broad
levels of science

471
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,890
scientific description.

472
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,510
We added all the controlled

473
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,555
vocabularies that we
use for all the,

474
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:37,215
individual journal submission

475
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,675
systems that was now
gathered into one.

476
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:42,070
We went from, four thousand

477
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,090
concept to fifty five thousand

478
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,210
in two years.

479
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,490
And now for, building
the topic pages,

480
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:51,885
willing that to
a piece that is

481
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:54,685
built on
automatically extracted

482
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:58,300
concepts from
the back of the book

483
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,400
index, from glossaries,

484
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,760
and and other resources,

485
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,620
and we're up to seven hundred

486
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,520
thousand concepts.

487
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,525
We use for crosswalks,
classification,

488
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:10,445
annotation, and
recommendation.

489
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,625
And, well, these
are the fields

490
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,925
of science that I covered.

491
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,810
So medicine still represents

492
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,850
twenty percent of omniscience

493
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,170
because our content is still

494
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,695
mostly targeting, yeah,

495
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:28,475
health sciences
and life science.

496
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,195
But engineering and renewable

497
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:34,170
energy or energy
in general are

498
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,010
moving into the,

499
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,950
the proportion that went from

500
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,170
one percent to, yeah,

501
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,030
like seven percent
or five percent.

502
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,945
And I'm sure that it's still

503
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:45,485
that the strand
is still gonna,

504
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:47,405
be followed.

505
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,685
So the main challenge
is how to grow,

506
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,830
the vocabulary and keep it

507
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,670
accurate because
we want the topic

508
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,810
pages to be,

509
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,210
representing truthful
information,

510
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,335
but we want the topic pages to

511
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,735
be on the latest,
topics of research.

512
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,415
So we need to have the latest

513
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,015
information, and we need to be

514
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,300
sure that it's
put at the right

515
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,080
place with the right set of,

516
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,060
synonyms and the right set of

517
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,420
relationship to make sure that

518
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,435
the topic page
wouldn't be, yeah,

519
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:20,155
incorrect and not that useful

520
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:20,975
for our customers.

521
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:22,795
So we grow topic,

522
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,115
we grow OmniScience based on,

523
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:28,220
customers' communities,
so mostly by,

524
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,880
getting updates from,

525
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,640
public vocabularies that are

526
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,960
updated clearly or at a higher

527
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,800
frequency. So we
keep up to date

528
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,325
with what most scientists are

529
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:40,785
using as reference
vocabularies.

530
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:43,645
We, get feedback from our

531
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,620
customers' needs based
on search logs,

532
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,360
and we try to make sure that

533
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,260
these are covered.

534
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,300
We also have system
of extraction

535
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,620
for the, trending
and influential

536
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,005
topics that are
automatically extracted,

537
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:00,685
from last month's research and

538
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:03,070
curated by SMEs and placed at

539
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,690
the proper place
in the taxonomy.

540
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,910
That would be
a topic on its own

541
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,170
to see how can we streamline

542
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,525
the process of injection
of new entries.

543
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:16,865
And then product
project needs.

544
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:18,805
So, as I mentioned,

545
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,830
topic page that I was doing in

546
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,990
interacted with, Reaxys.

547
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,270
So for this, linking between,

548
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,865
two products or
projects or use cases,

549
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:31,785
we had to expand the taxonomy

550
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,625
in the chemistry domain.

551
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,130
So based on the, the global,

552
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,690
products that we're serving,

553
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,210
policy or roadmaps,
let's say,

554
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,825
we expand one
branch or another.

555
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:47,725
But for all of this,

556
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,725
what we really
want to do is to

557
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,040
deliver data that is
high quality data.

558
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,900
So how do we make sure that we

559
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,695
do have this?

560
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,575
Because we are
using linked data

561
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:03,375
standards, we can
rely on standard

562
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,215
ways of QA ing.

563
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,430
So whenever one
of the twelve,

564
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,010
taxonomy team
develop a specific

565
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,990
QA mechanism, we can apply it

566
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,585
to other vocabularies also,

567
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:16,085
And that saves us
a lot of time and,

568
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:19,025
and that allows us to share

569
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,045
information and to produce

570
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:24,930
standard standard
reports also,

571
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,630
not only standard
QA procedure,

572
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,670
QA pipelines,

573
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,370
but but reports
because we build

574
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,810
it on the same tools and on

575
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,710
the same models.

576
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:35,575
So the taxonomy
management system

577
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,815
is based on a triple
store and,

578
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,235
so we're using RDF, SCOSXL,

579
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,195
for representation.

580
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,790
We're using Shackle's,
expressiveness.

581
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,530
For example, we have,

582
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,495
regular expression
based way of

583
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:51,175
checking that a CAS number

584
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,175
attached to
a concept that is,

585
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:55,495
a chemical entity is a correct

586
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:57,595
CAS number. So if
you're doing a typo,

587
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
the system will
tell it to you,

588
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
and it's based on
standard linked

589
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,100
data technology.

590
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,460
We use SPARQL for
producing reports,

591
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,665
subsets, and doing release

592
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:12,525
type of global QA.

593
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:14,265
We're using, yeah,

594
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,425
pandas and
an extension of pandas

595
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,380
to doing batch
processes because

596
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,880
it's all tables and
RDF triple based.

597
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,980
We try to reuse as much as

598
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,725
possible because
we can do faster

599
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,585
life cycles now
that our taxonomies

600
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:31,205
are not dedicated to
a given product,

601
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:33,660
but dedicated to some branches

602
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,820
with a lot of
metadata that allow,

603
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,220
modularization and rebuild.

604
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,160
And the publication
is done also

605
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,695
through a triple
store where the,

606
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:44,855
different customers
can pick up

607
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:45,995
the latest release.

608
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:49,950
And, because we are publishing

609
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,230
as a trig, so,

610
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,250
all the sparkle and shackle,

611
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,670
QA validation
rules are part of

612
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,285
the data model that is sent to

613
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:00,965
the publication triple stored

614
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:03,785
together with the data
in a trig file,

615
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:06,245
then everybody
down the line has

616
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,450
a self sustainable,

617
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,530
unit of information that gives

618
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,370
the semantics of
the data together

619
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,190
with the data.

620
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,630
The publishing
triple store has

621
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,725
dereferencing and browsing UI

622
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:20,805
for manual use, but
also, of course,

623
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:22,885
a lot of APIs and a sparkle

624
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:24,665
endpoint for automatic
interaction.

625
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,170
So that is a glimpse of what

626
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,810
we're doing with
linked data at

627
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,650
Elsevier, and I thank you for

628
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,390
your attention.

629
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,365
I'll be in the room
for more questions.

630
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:36,965
Thank you very much.
