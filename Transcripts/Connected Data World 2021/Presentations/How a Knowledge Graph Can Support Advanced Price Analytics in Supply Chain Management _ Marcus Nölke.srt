00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,100
Hello.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,980
Thanks for the introduction,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,535
and welcome to the talk
on the application

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,335
of a knowledge
graph to enhance

5
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,415
price analytics in
the procurement

6
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:21,490
domain. Before we
look at the agenda,

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,170
let me introduce myself.

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,690
My name is Markus Noelke.

9
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,685
I work for Siemens Energy,

10
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,405
now for more than ten years.

11
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:34,665
My office is located
at the factory

12
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:36,950
in Mulheim close
to Dusseldorf.

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,750
As a cost value engineer,

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,990
I act as a bridge
between engineering,

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,350
procurement, suppliers,

16
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,845
with focus on improving our

17
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,065
product cost position.

18
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,325
For cost transparency and

19
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:53,720
identification of
cost out potential,

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,840
I utilize extensively
data analytics.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,080
In the presentation,

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,220
I will explain the use case or

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,780
motivation for the application

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,545
of an application,

25
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,345
with details on
used ontologies,

26
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,390
patterns, and tools.

27
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:22,505
Presentation is
structured as follows.

28
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,505
I will give a short overview

29
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:26,930
about Siemens Energy and then

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,110
explain what I
mean by advanced

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,890
price analytics and
will show you,

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,970
the related knowledge graph

33
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,885
implementation.
And I will close

34
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,125
out with a short
summary and and

35
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,105
next steps.

36
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:42,165
But let us first,

37
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,910
start with the introduction of

38
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,230
Siemens Energy.

39
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,150
Siemens Energy is active in

40
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,290
the energy market,

41
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:53,715
mainly as an equipment
supplier,

42
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:55,795
with a global footprint.

43
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:58,755
More than fifty percent
on the worldwide

44
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:01,050
installed generation capacity

45
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,990
is based on our technology.

46
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,670
Although we have
a fossil background,

47
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,910
we are transforming
to renewables,

48
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,285
and our our
portfolio is already

49
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:14,025
more than fifty
percent carbon free.

50
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,185
Along our core products,

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
we offer solutions and and

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,620
services mainly
maintenance and repair.

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,055
We have products
in generation,

54
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,695
transmission, and
storage of energy.

55
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,155
The portfolio ranges from

56
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:35,570
conventional
equipment like gas

57
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,510
turbines, to renewables,

58
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,870
like wind turbines,

59
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,470
through our daughter,
we, Garmesa,

60
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,510
Siemens Garmesa,

61
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,335
and to hydrogen generators.

62
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,815
The use case currently focuses

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,060
on conventional gas turbines.

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,000
So let us have a look
at the product

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,260
structure and, the, related,

66
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,020
supply chain.

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,840
Our product portfolio
is, quite large,

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,280
including systems,

69
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,715
with subsystems or
sub subsystems.

70
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:21,515
So here on the left,
you can see,

71
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,735
there's a complete gas fired

72
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:27,020
power plant, which we sell.

73
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,780
And then what we also sell is

74
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,960
the just the gas
turbine package,

75
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,280
which is within
this power plant.

76
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:35,825
And the gas turbine
package can

77
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:37,425
be further broken down into

78
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,505
the core engine,
the gas turbine,

79
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,105
the actual gas
turbine which we

80
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,485
manufacture in house,

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,800
and also auxiliary
elements like

82
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,980
the air intake which provides

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,840
filter air to
the filter air to

84
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,060
the to the gas turbine.

85
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,955
So this, we buy,

86
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,115
complete as a as a system,

87
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,755
but as mentioned,
the gas turbine,

88
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:02,140
that is manufactured
in house.

89
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,200
So here, we need to
further break down,

90
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,640
into components,

91
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,275
which are quite numerous.

92
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:12,795
So from machine parts
to raw material,

93
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,415
standard parts like bolts and

94
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,240
nuts and and and and so on.

95
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,880
And and so we we buy all sorts

96
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,120
of things from
systems all the way

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,525
down to to raw material
and also seems,

98
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,385
energy buys a lot at about ten

99
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,725
billion euros annually.

100
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,125
It's the purchase volume.

101
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,720
Almost all components,

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,400
are engineered with,
lot size one.

103
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,600
They vary from
project to project

104
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,415
most often.

105
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,555
And, yeah,

106
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,155
the specification are always

107
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,015
need need to always
to be adapted.

108
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,700
We have a global
purchasing footprint,

109
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,660
with regional
hubs, and, like,

110
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,760
with global supply
base, of course,

111
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,525
following our projects and and

112
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:07,945
customers. And we
have, lastly,

113
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,970
facing strong competition and

114
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,230
our our cost base is
heavily influenced,

115
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,230
of course, by
the external supply,

116
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,510
and we have to to
buy at best price.

117
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:21,915
And there we have
finally our use case.

118
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,095
We use data
analytics to detail

119
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,350
to to determine if we actually

120
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,650
buy always throughout
the entire

121
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,630
organization at best
price possible.

122
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,285
And one example or one method

123
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,585
here is the, perform what we

124
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,125
call the performance pricing.

125
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,605
That means relating,

126
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,480
the price of
a purchased item,

127
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,920
to its aspects
and properties.

128
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:53,255
So here is one example
of a dashboard

129
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:55,195
with an air intake portfolio,

130
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,055
where prices for
air intakes are

131
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:01,000
shown globally
for our entire,

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,780
gas turbine,
portfolio from from

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,980
small gas turbines,

134
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,555
with low mass
flow to large gas

135
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,415
turbines with
a large mass flow,

136
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,495
and we have all
the cost information,

137
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,740
mapped here in this chart over

138
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,220
the mass flow.
And and we have,

139
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,340
one one type of
of data is from

140
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,515
from our estimated from our

141
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:25,055
product tracking databases,

142
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:26,875
for instance, from proposal

143
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,335
calculation and so on.

144
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,180
And the other
prices are actually

145
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,880
projection prices from from

146
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,960
purchase orders
which are fixed,

147
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,000
and this can also
be shown here.

148
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:39,945
And, with this method,

149
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:42,725
you can compare
price over a wide

150
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,225
range of application
with varying

151
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:48,440
parameters. The results might

152
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,620
be a benchmark
prices so you can

153
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,240
determine an average
price line

154
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,255
here for instance
over the the entire

155
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,835
portfolio, or you can even

156
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,695
determine a lowest
price line,

157
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,460
or you can investigate further

158
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
outliers here, and and and do

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,300
further drill down.

160
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,935
So, also,

161
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,935
you can derive
target cost here

162
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:14,295
if you want. So if you design

163
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,815
a new gas turbine and you just

164
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,195
know the functional
parameter,

165
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,400
mass flow, you can go in here

166
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,900
and determine a price for this

167
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,280
component which
is not actually

168
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,740
designed at this
point in time.

169
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:29,295
So that is, as you can see,

170
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,155
that is a very simple method

171
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,615
with just one parameter but in

172
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,450
reality we have
of course several

173
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,470
parameters, which are crucial

174
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,730
for for for for
influencing the price,

175
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,910
which we call
the cost driver,

176
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,465
and and they need
to be evaluated

177
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,705
in a multivariate regression.

178
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,565
But also, you can
see that this

179
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:55,270
easy statistical method also

180
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,030
relies on the collection and

181
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,610
integration of lots of data

182
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,795
throughout the whole supply

183
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,015
chain organization,

184
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,155
but also integrating a lot of

185
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,215
technical information.

186
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,555
And that is the problem we try

187
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:12,680
to solve with
the knowledge graph.

188
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,960
But there are some
challenges as,

189
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,680
yep, as probably in
many organizations.

190
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,405
We have,

191
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,365
unstructured data like pricing

192
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,705
information comes
to PDF technical

193
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:30,860
documentation. We
have Excel sheets.

194
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,760
We have drawings.

195
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,000
Some information
comes, per email.

196
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:39,095
Also, as shown, we
have high complexity,

197
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:40,695
of products.

198
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:43,575
So the it's
quite heterogeneous

199
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:44,615
what we buy.

200
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:49,030
We have also procurement and

201
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,130
also engineering
and manufacturing

202
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,290
is distributed globally.

203
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:58,175
We have that really
results also

204
00:08:58,175 --> 00:08:59,235
in different philosophies,

205
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:00,675
legacy systems,

206
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,355
and and related vocabulary.

207
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,840
And, of course,

208
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,800
we have data more organized in

209
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,680
applications, and if data is

210
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,885
pulled out of its relational

211
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:15,165
databases mostly
the context is gone.

212
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:18,825
So, the general
idea here is to

213
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,550
use a good knowledge graph,

214
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,690
to integrate, the data and,

215
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,130
defining a shared vocabulary

216
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,155
across all the domains,
procurement,

217
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,435
engineering,
technical vocabulary,

218
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,955
but also service,
for instance,

219
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:37,835
and manufacturing.

220
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,060
And there, the idea is to,

221
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,035
to have a data integration cut

222
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:52,115
from within based
on on the knowledge

223
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:54,615
graph, and then
we bring together

224
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,855
all the transactional data,

225
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,110
planning data,
design data from

226
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,610
various data silos,
and, we map them,

227
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,545
to the individual
concepts classes,

228
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:08,245
and and and shared
the vocabulary,

229
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,085
and and we can evaluate it.

230
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:11,685
And in that process,

231
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:13,525
information becomes knowledge

232
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,700
that can be formally processed

233
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,100
by a machine. So here,

234
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,080
this is one example.

235
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,220
Firefront is assigned a unit,

236
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,900
which is defined in the core

237
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,845
ontology of the QEDT.

238
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:27,485
Then we have,

239
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:31,145
okay we say it's
an inlet mass flow,

240
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:32,620
it's a value for an inlet mass

241
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
flow which is defined
in the domain

242
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,860
ontology that can
also be defined

243
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,560
by international standards.

244
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,140
And then,

245
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,605
this inlet mass flow is mapped

246
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,185
to to technical asset,
the air intake,

247
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,505
which has also a corresponding

248
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,265
semantic definition.

249
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,745
It's it's a technical asset,

250
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,010
which again is defined in in

251
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,990
the core ontology.

252
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,970
And then, yeah,

253
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,695
this this data with
a shared vocabulary,

254
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:03,575
this map data can
then be shared

255
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,095
to applications
through an API,

256
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,050
and the apps can query content

257
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,770
from the notice
graph via sparkle

258
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,745
queries. And and here we have

259
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,765
also on the top our
performance pricing,

260
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,625
dashboards, but also, yeah,

261
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:25,540
just simple query
visualizations,

262
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
traversing the graph,
doing graph,

263
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,580
explorations is
also possible.

264
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,575
But let's look further
at the ontology

265
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,135
framework, we are using here.

266
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,690
So modeling scope,
respectively,

267
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,430
technical assets is is done

268
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,655
along with the ISO
and the asset

269
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,495
specification model
from the REDI

270
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,795
project. So here,
the gas turbine,

271
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:56,975
in this example,

272
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,620
the gas turbine
auxiliary system

273
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,780
is modeled, with a system

274
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,720
engineering
approach starting,

275
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,660
with the main system and,

276
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,615
breaking it further
down into,

277
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,875
subcomponents, all the way to

278
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,855
the bottom here.

279
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:15,235
So that is that generally is

280
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,695
done related to aspects,

281
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:19,320
to the aspects
function, product,

282
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,260
and location as per the ISO,

283
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,820
eight one three four six.

284
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,345
The product aspect
is here omitted

285
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,965
for the sake of, simplicity.

286
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:30,825
So function and
location are here,

287
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:33,805
part of quite
quite a different

288
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,690
breakdown of hierarchies.

289
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,490
And and, by mixing
the two aspects,

290
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,810
variable context contextual,

291
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,210
information is is is lost.

292
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:45,965
And and here also location can

293
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,465
be referred to,
boundary conditions,

294
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,225
where you apply your
technical assets.

295
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,960
Along with the aspects,

296
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,160
functional properties,

297
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,780
we we which are modeled here,

298
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,895
which is the the power,
for instance,

299
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,555
requirement for the guest,

300
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,935
auxiliary system,

301
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,095
and also the mass flow.

302
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,830
We can also,

303
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,870
model location
related properties,

304
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,670
which wind which
is wind speed,

305
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,605
temperature,
which is different

306
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,605
indoor than,
compared to outdoor.

307
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:26,520
And, so and and
then, the the,

308
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,140
and an integrated
object is created,

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,740
through connecting,

310
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
the respective objects in in

311
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,180
the hierarchies,

312
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,455
and that is basically
the specification

313
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:39,295
for for this, intake.

314
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:42,800
And, it's it's
a functional object,

315
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
and it integrates
all the aspects

316
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,840
and and,

317
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
and all the requirements are

318
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,100
then flowing down,

319
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,235
to this functional object.

320
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:58,815
And, then this objects can be

321
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,460
also related to
to offers being

322
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,760
made for such an asset,
or purchased,

323
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,660
orders being placed.

324
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,495
And this gives the connection

325
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,095
between the cost data,

326
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,175
and the technical parameters,

327
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,495
which can then be utilized,

328
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:17,520
in the performance,
pricing effort.

329
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
But be before we get to that,

330
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,600
I show you how to,
to model the,

331
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,220
the properties.

332
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,740
So what what are the typical

333
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,205
property patterns here?

334
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:31,105
Here we have,

335
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,905
the the ISO one five nine two

336
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:37,540
six fourteen pattern
with a verification

337
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,340
, which has a higher,
expressivity,

338
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,620
than modeling
properties directly,

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,820
to the assets.

340
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,725
So, yeah, here we have,

341
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,425
the the the type,

342
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:52,205
of of of the property as a as

343
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,470
a as an instance
of of a class,

344
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,830
where the class is,

345
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,630
this is the nominal
operating mass flow,

346
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,775
which is defined by
a g force standard.

347
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,095
And it can also, classify,

348
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:09,650
the functional object
further into,

349
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,910
an oil and gas type
of equipment.

350
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,390
And then to this,
mass flow instance,

351
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,485
we have the actual value,

352
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:24,185
connected and also,
the, the unit,

353
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,025
which is coming
from QEDT or is

354
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,645
mapped to the QEDT framework.

355
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,620
For the purchase order,

356
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,100
the quotation here,
we have to map,

357
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,455
for instance,
a monetary value,

358
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:38,715
which is,

359
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:42,735
a class from defined
in in the Fibo

360
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,810
ontology. And and
there, we have,

361
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,050
also, yeah, the value,

362
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,950
then the verification,

363
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,395
with the value connected and

364
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:54,335
also the currency connected.

365
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,375
And and the currency,

366
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,735
is defined also
through the Fibro

367
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,270
ontology where you have all

368
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,270
the currencies and
all the country

369
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,770
codes, mapped,

370
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,850
and and defined
in the ontology.

371
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,485
So yeah. And and
that brings us

372
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,645
then to the, yeah,

373
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,520
to the integration
and into our

374
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,240
use case.

375
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,420
And, here's the example,

376
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,500
we we looked at already.

377
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,145
And here you can see how how

378
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,605
everything comes together.

379
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,305
So we have here now,

380
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:33,045
the our functional
object, basically,

381
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:38,300
with the connected
estimated as pricing,

382
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,300
for instance,
from a quotation.

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,700
And we have the properties

384
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,585
basically here
from from this,

385
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:46,525
asset specification model.

386
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:48,845
So in this case,
the mass flow,

387
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,045
which are then maps,

388
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,980
so we we have this
connection here,

389
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,560
and we have also
the connection

390
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,360
here of to the purchase
part, which is,

391
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,460
coming from a purchase order

392
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,835
transaction for a different,

393
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,215
functional object,

394
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,575
and and that gives
us the possibility,

395
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:12,000
to, derive that, dashboard,

396
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,980
in an automatic way,

397
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,340
for all sorts of
technical assets

398
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,860
which are defined
in the knowledge

399
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,745
graph and all,
defines, technical,

400
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,365
or properties or qualities we

401
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:27,565
have in the knowledge graph or

402
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,600
which can be fine,

403
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,200
and and then we can do our

404
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,060
analytics based on that.

405
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,775
But, to make that all work,

406
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,315
we need reasoning.

407
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,020
Here, it's based on on all,

408
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,380
or additional data log rules,

409
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,020
based on
the RDFox implementation

410
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,365
we have here in in
various areas.

411
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:59,885
So one one example
here is the,

412
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,520
the property allocation from

413
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,260
the partonomies.

414
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,580
So if you're on top,
we have defined,

415
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,020
power requirement.

416
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,160
It is,

417
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,355
then serving down to
the subcomponents,

418
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,235
basically. Also,

419
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,730
the part of is is also
it's a transitive

420
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,870
property, so you
have also that

421
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,610
that connection.

422
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,510
But for instance,

423
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,110
if the filtration is also part

424
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,835
of the GG auxiliary
system that

425
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,855
is then a separate property,

426
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:36,515
so do not not mix direct part

427
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,775
relationship to to to indirect

428
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,610
part relationships.

429
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,050
Then we have
the aggregation of cost.

430
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,230
So if you have,

431
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,665
a percolation scheme where we

432
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,405
have to add, yeah,
certain components,

433
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:54,065
and and and aggregate it into

434
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,200
into a higher scope,
for instance,

435
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
for mechanical
equipment for a certain

436
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
project. That is
also done through

437
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,425
reasoning, and we
have the integration

438
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:09,765
of the data with
identifier matching.

439
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:11,685
So here,

440
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:15,710
ISO eight one
three four six IDs

441
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,270
can be used, or also,

442
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,945
legacy identifiers
from the various

443
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:25,685
databases to bring,
the data together.

444
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:27,105
And then finally, we have,

445
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,590
constraint checking here with

446
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,310
subclass requirements
to check if,

447
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,650
certain technical assets,

448
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,905
where we have the, yeah,

449
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,685
requirements for for certain

450
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:42,785
technical values if they are

451
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,845
present and also
if they are in

452
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,810
a certain range.

453
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,350
And and and here, yeah,

454
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,890
we need to rely also on closed

455
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,630
word reasoning,

456
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,270
which is also coming
from the RDFox

457
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,645
database technology.

458
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:02,085
And that leads me
to the architecture

459
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,005
which is implemented.

460
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,750
So this is the software
architecture,

461
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,790
starting from the from
the data sources.

462
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,105
So here we have
a center query,

463
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,165
point, via Denodo.

464
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:19,805
Through an ODBC connection,

465
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:23,480
we can access, for
instance, SAP data,

466
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,400
or other databases.

467
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,560
We have connected
Oracle database,

468
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,800
Redshift data warehouse,

469
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,605
and or a simple Excel sheets.

470
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,805
And then, yeah,
we can, via SQL,

471
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,760
we can get the tabular data.

472
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,260
And in in in the SQL lens,

473
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,360
this data is then using the r

474
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,280
two r m l mapping
files or mapping

475
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,205
language, is then transferred

476
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:54,365
into r d f RDF,

477
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:57,305
so called n quotes
which contain

478
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:00,490
also as a fourth
dimension the provenance

479
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,770
data, that is put into
the TRIPISSTORM,

480
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:07,835
yeah, which contains
all the provenance

481
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,535
data and all historical data.

482
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:11,695
And then, yeah,

483
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:13,775
through either
direct replication

484
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:15,740
or special queries we have

485
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,320
connected our RDFox
reasoning engine,

486
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,800
which is, yeah
executing in memory,

487
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,885
inferencing and
reasoning based

488
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,705
on data log rules
or old ontologies.

489
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:31,565
And, yeah.

490
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,585
And that is the the databases

491
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,490
are queried through,

492
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,030
the Metafactory front
end, which is,

493
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,430
a low code, yeah,

494
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,535
tool to enable traversing,

495
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,735
through the graph
and visualizing

496
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,300
graph data, within
HTML pages,

497
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,320
and so that the spaCy queries

498
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
can be directly
incorporated in

499
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,300
HTML pages.

500
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,835
And also there are
web connectors

501
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:06,095
defined for a dashboard tool

502
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:06,835
like Tableau,

503
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,720
where you can directly then,

504
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,900
from Tableau,

505
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,620
query into through Metafactory

506
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,575
query into the data
in the graph

507
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:18,815
database, which
is not directly

508
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:19,955
possible from Tableau.

509
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:22,335
And also, yeah, you can,

510
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:23,310
through Metafactory, factory,

511
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:26,470
you can realize certain class

512
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,550
based visualizations or just

513
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,970
simple graph
exploration schemes.

514
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:32,415
And, of course,

515
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,175
that is then
connected to a user

516
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:38,435
management system.
Alright. That's all.

517
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,740
So I would like to conclude

518
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,720
the talk with
conclusion and and

519
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,740
also some next steps.

520
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,845
So I think the, the,

521
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,785
knowledge graph is
a good solution

522
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,105
for for applying performance

523
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,285
pricing at scale.

524
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:58,500
It really reduces,

525
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
the manual work we have to do

526
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
right now to collect
all the data

527
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,700
to clean,

528
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,285
and and and to to put it into

529
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,385
a spreadsheet so we
can analyze it.

530
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,705
So with this approach,

531
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,340
an automatic or semiautomatic

532
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,780
performance pricing throughout

533
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,105
all components
we are buying is

534
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:27,165
possible. But, also,
what is what is,

535
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,410
yeah, I think, clear is that

536
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,090
the supply chain
is in a difficult

537
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,930
domain to model because we we

538
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,750
are more inter
interface, discipline.

539
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,470
So we rely on on
on good data,

540
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:41,705
and the right data
models from from,

541
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,205
engineering, from the product

542
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:45,645
life cycle management.

543
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,280
And, yeah, then so
so we, we and and,

544
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,140
also, they they said
the the models,

545
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,740
are quite heterogeneous,

546
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:59,685
and that makes life difficult

547
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,845
in in the knowledge graph.

548
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,510
And, also, I think,

549
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,690
closed word reasoning
is is essential,

550
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,910
to get, yeah,
the reasoning we we need,

551
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,515
to to make connections and and

552
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:15,695
to to do the constraint
checking here.

553
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,835
And, yeah, possible
next steps,

554
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,180
I would say, from
my perspective,

555
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,100
is really adding, equations.

556
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,860
So once we have
the statistical

557
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:31,045
analytics in place and we have

558
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:32,105
to derive, for instance,

559
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:36,105
a parametric formula
for an intake,

560
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:37,765
I would like to put that into

561
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:40,070
the graph and
also do reasoning

562
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,630
against that.

563
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,630
So if if, let's say,

564
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,550
identifying outliers based on

565
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,210
that and and
utilizing the numeric

566
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,755
calculation also for further,

567
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,615
analytics. And,
also, of course,

568
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:56,375
it would be very nice to link

569
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,890
external data, like
a material index.

570
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,950
So for instance, if you have,

571
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,830
so you can map, for instance,

572
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,255
for all technical assets which

573
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,935
use in certain carbon steel.

574
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,155
You can map easily,

575
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,055
the price index and have,

576
00:25:12,615 --> 00:25:15,095
direct information
flowing into,

577
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,940
what are the price,

578
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,880
what is the price increase for

579
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,820
this particular raw material.

580
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,495
Also very important for for

581
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,655
certain for tracking, price,

582
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:29,235
for for tracking,

583
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:32,195
price movements in
the in the market.

584
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,500
Yeah. And lastly,

585
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,880
I think also it's it's a good

586
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,560
possibility to to do,

587
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
data exchange with
your business

588
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,100
partners, with
your suppliers,

589
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,875
but also with your customers.

590
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,855
So with suppliers,

591
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:47,235
I could imagine that
at the end that,

592
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:50,940
proposals, are
really exchanged

593
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,440
through the knowledge graph,

594
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,420
and we don't get PDFs,
which we have to,

595
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,740
then evaluate further.

596
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,685
So and extract
the valuable information,

597
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:03,805
but, yeah, so we can
get, already the,

598
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:06,450
the semantic
enriched information

599
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,250
from a supplier.

600
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,950
And, also, we have already

601
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,690
projects with customers where

602
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,270
they are asking for a certain

603
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,065
data model, for
instance, in Geforce,

604
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,565
which needs to be modeled in,

605
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:20,525
in an old graph. Yeah.

606
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:23,160
So that's concluding
my talk, and,

607
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,260
yeah, I'm happy to answer

608
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,660
additional questions.
Thanks a lot.
