00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,740
Hi. Greetings, everybody.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,260
My name is Mike.

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,755
I'm going to present,

4
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,415
the business case for Semantic

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:15,695
Data Management.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,035
This is a consolidation
of what

7
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,780
I've learned over
the past almost

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,960
four decades of being
the therapist,

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,660
scribe, and analyst
for the data

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,800
management industry.

11
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,005
Alright. So first,

12
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,845
let's start off
by understanding

13
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,720
that there is a prime goal,

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,180
what I call a prime directive

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,540
for data management,

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,400
and that is to ensure that all

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,035
the users have trust
and confidence

18
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,775
that the data that
they're using

19
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:50,675
for their applications,

20
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,235
is true to origin.

21
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:54,915
And they should do so,

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,740
without the need
for reconciliation

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,180
and without the need
for multiple

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,460
data transformations.

25
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,115
If you think about it,

26
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:06,055
and we put this in
context for you,

27
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,735
you have a right to,

28
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,555
want I'm gonna say a right to

29
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:11,840
expect the data that you're

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,140
using to be true to
original intent.

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,260
Right? Not transformed, not,

32
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,695
mismatched or incongruent,

33
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,675
because it represents
real things.

34
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,375
Right? So it should be defined

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,240
at the most granular atomic

36
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,580
level to actually be able to

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,080
capture the reality
of the things

38
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,120
that it's represented.

39
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,665
It should be available
when you need it,

40
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,465
when, when your,
analysts want it.

41
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:44,840
They should be
able to get it,

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,200
themselves as they think about

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,100
what they need.

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,820
So it's a key part
of your asset

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,805
inventory along with your

46
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,505
processes and
your technologies

47
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:56,945
and your requirements.

48
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:00,305
The format should support,

49
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,570
scenario based
analytics. Right?

50
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,030
You you don't want it to be

51
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,130
stuck in the rigid
technology that,

52
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,585
you have to then
kind of unravel

53
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:11,925
before you can use. Right?

54
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,305
So it should be flexible.

55
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,205
We need it to be traceable as

56
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:20,280
it flows across
our systems and

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,440
through our calculations and

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,540
into our aggregation
processes.

59
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,815
We'd like it to
be testable for

60
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,795
fit for purpose,

61
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:31,855
to make sure it matches all

62
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,650
the logic requirements for

63
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,890
processing as well
as the quality

64
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,850
requirements, and that should

65
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,150
be done automatically.

66
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,615
We'd like it to be
self describing

67
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,635
so that the meaning
of the data

68
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:46,115
is embedded in
the content itself

69
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,455
and reusable. Right?

70
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:49,270
There's building blocks for us

71
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,610
to put the data to work.

72
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,550
And I will tell you that this

73
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,930
is all completely achievable.

74
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,330
That's completely
achievable right now.

75
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,845
Without a huge investment
in technology,

76
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,965
but it does
require organizational

77
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:07,765
adjustment. And in
order to do that,

78
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,790
the, the stakeholders must

79
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,070
understand it. They must have

80
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,370
cognition about
the problem and the,

81
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,045
pathway to solutions.

82
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:21,165
And there must be
leadership because,

83
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:22,985
this is an act of change,

84
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,345
and we wanna make sure that we

85
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,030
can deal with
the organizational

86
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,710
challenges that exist.

87
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,230
And those are the primary

88
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,930
obstacles for implementing any

89
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,330
new paradigm change that this

90
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,815
represents. So
let's take a look

91
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,215
at the challenges. Right?

92
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:41,075
So first we should recognize

93
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,355
that there are,

94
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,510
an infrastructure based on

95
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,810
relational technologies,

96
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,150
that are well over
fifty years old.

97
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,010
It's a lifetime
in technology.

98
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,175
That technology
sometimes leads

99
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,415
to wrong outcomes
that seem like

100
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,395
they are appropriate,

101
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,460
but actually wind
up being false

102
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,560
narratives in
today's technology

103
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,120
environment. And
that's compounded

104
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,995
by cultural obstacles,

105
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:11,475
associated with
organizational change.

106
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:12,895
Alright. So let's take a look

107
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,835
at these things
at in in-depth.

108
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,950
Right? And the technology,
of course,

109
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,990
is the biggest part of it,

110
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,510
but we have
fragmentation of our

111
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,130
technology, and we
all know that.

112
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,735
Silos exist,
functional silos,

113
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:27,095
process silos,
business silos,

114
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,855
geographic silos.

115
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,400
And those silos are managed

116
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,240
independently.
And sometimes we

117
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
have technology
that is different

118
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,685
in each silo. That technology

119
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,525
is driven by proprietary
data models,

120
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,325
proprietary quality engines,

121
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:46,005
proprietary glossaries,

122
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,140
and they don't
match each other.

123
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,060
So we've done things
independently,

124
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,980
not reusable.

125
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,985
We're looking at
an environment

126
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,825
where we have a couple
pair. Right?

127
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,765
Location based processing,

128
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:02,405
where you have
a column and a row,

129
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,030
you know, expressed as a table

130
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,610
linked with joins
and keys where

131
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,345
relationships have
been constructed

132
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,265
explicitly, and
we've done stuff

133
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,865
to optimize because
we have lots

134
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,805
of data that we
have to manage.

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
We've been copying data and

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,580
moving into the silos and

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
torturing it to death and

138
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,600
transforming it
and renaming it

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,860
to make sure that it
fits the glossary

140
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,435
that drives the software that

141
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:30,195
propels the data model that

142
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,255
drives the application.

143
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:35,640
That has result in a brittle

144
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,640
infrastructure that
is inflexible,

145
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,100
and sometimes we are afraid to

146
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
change it, not
well documented,

147
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,105
and it drives critical
applications.

148
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,565
This is what we refer to as

149
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,625
technical debt,

150
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,685
plus we have hard time tracing

151
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,285
it as it flows
through our systems,

152
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,220
both technical lineage
and the business

153
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,840
provenance for
the calculations.

154
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,575
You combine that with concepts

155
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:00,835
that seem appropriate,

156
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,015
like the single
version of the truth,

157
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,595
which was appropriate when you

158
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,775
only had one
repository of data.

159
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,900
But now we
the reality is there

160
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,580
are many, and we're not gonna

161
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,340
be able to get our arms around

162
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,505
all of the repositories of all

163
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:16,285
of our functional applications

164
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,725
across the world.

165
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,685
So we just have
to kind of accept

166
00:06:20,985 --> 00:06:23,290
that standard standardization

167
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,930
of meaning is,
a better strategy

168
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,250
than trying to force
fit everything

169
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,890
into a single model
or into a centralized

170
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,425
repository. And
that model itself,

171
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,745
right, we we we
understand the value

172
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:37,445
of a canonical model describes

173
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,205
relationships. Right?
That's important.

174
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,640
But having one model that

175
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,620
describes everything,

176
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
is just not practical.

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
It would be out of date before

178
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,480
it was finished,

179
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,680
and you would spend all your

180
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,865
time trying to catch up with

181
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,085
the pace of your activity,

182
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:54,485
and that is not what
we're trying to do.

183
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:56,545
These problems,

184
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,510
these technological
problems and

185
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,270
objective problems lead us to

186
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,950
the two big
challenges. Right?

187
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,090
We have, multiple
identifiers.

188
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:10,435
We have, codes all
over our systems.

189
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,295
We've changed and
modified those

190
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,755
for various contacts.

191
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
We're we're we're
having a difficult

192
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,840
time making sure that this is

193
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,080
the same as that,
which is compounded,

194
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,620
of course, because there's no

195
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,300
meaning that's
been locked down.

196
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,085
And and meaning
is is different

197
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:29,025
when you have, front office

198
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,405
transactions process
versus a back

199
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:34,530
office legal and,
a settlement process.

200
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,610
So identity and
meaning, have become,

201
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,405
incongruent. You
combine that with,

202
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:45,225
you know, it seems
logical. Right?

203
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,485
We try to create a a,

204
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,440
an application
for an important

205
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,880
customer, but we do that over

206
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,020
and over and over again,

207
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
making lots of
micro decisions,

208
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:58,195
becomes hardwired and
yet another silo.

209
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,055
Without business
rules that have

210
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:01,795
been documented,

211
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,395
they're not machine
executable,

212
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,900
and we're operating off of,

213
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,900
next quarter spreadsheet with

214
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,040
the pace of business,

215
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,700
trying to push things,

216
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,765
so we wind up doing mostly

217
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:14,765
tactical activities to get us

218
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,765
out of the fire rather than

219
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:18,705
looking at
the problem strategically

220
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:20,810
as one that you can fix.

221
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,450
And we have to
be careful about

222
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,210
this quest for
magic solutions.

223
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,890
Right? Everybody that sells

224
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,545
technology always
says, you know,

225
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,545
this is the one
solution you need.

226
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,585
It might even seem like I'm

227
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:33,385
gonna sell magic,

228
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:36,125
but this is really
just conceptual,

229
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,450
understanding of
how things work.

230
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,510
Right? So if you look at those

231
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,510
challenges, and now let's take

232
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,770
a look now at the implications

233
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,605
of those challenges.

234
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,445
And these are
actual quotes that

235
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:48,625
I've been collecting
over the years

236
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:51,425
from people who are
going through the,

237
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,105
kind of, the data journey.

238
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,060
First one is, we can't
find this stuff.

239
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
Right? We don't
have a connected

240
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,260
inventory of our assets.

241
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,660
We made lots of copies.

242
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:06,335
We, we've changed
those copies.

243
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,935
We don't have
a process to prevent

244
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:10,095
duplication, so we don't know

245
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,615
where to go to get the data.

246
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,250
So it's a big problem of even

247
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,410
what exists and where do I get

248
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,990
it multiplied by,

249
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,025
the fact that it
doesn't match.

250
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,225
Right? So we have a hard time

251
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,845
integrating it, linking it,

252
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,505
making sure that
this is the same

253
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,785
as that, and,

254
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,025
we miss new we
have this problem

255
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,410
of same word,
different meaning,

256
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,650
different words,
same meaning.

257
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,810
A nuance is not passed
across processes,

258
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:39,345
and it comes from
using nomenclature

259
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,265
as the key for its activity.

260
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:43,085
I love this quote
at the end, right,

261
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,085
where it says, my projects end

262
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,770
up as expensive death marches

263
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,090
of cleansing, reconciliation,

264
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,630
manipulation just to
make the software

265
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,705
work. And that
story gets repeated

266
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,145
over and over again.

267
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:00,145
Because we're doing
it, in our silos,

268
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:03,230
we, began a local IT group to

269
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,670
build it specifically for me.

270
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,190
So we're not
coordinating across

271
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,050
processes, and
there's conflicts

272
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,090
and priorities and
winds up, being,

273
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:12,695
a bunch of,

274
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,375
independently defined designed

275
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,440
activities that leads to,

276
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,380
a lack of confidence
in usually

277
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,060
in technology for
being able to

278
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,340
implement what we want.

279
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,780
And you pull it
all together and

280
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,365
what we have is the lack of

281
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:30,065
trust in the data.

282
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,785
It's not fit for purpose.

283
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:35,005
We spend seventy
percent of our

284
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:38,680
time doing data
janitorial work

285
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,680
just to make sure
that the data

286
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,200
is right for an application.

287
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,680
We do that over and
over and over again.

288
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,515
I call this the bad data tax.

289
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:49,575
And I've done I've
done the research.

290
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:50,855
Actually, I've done
the research twice,

291
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,375
once with IBM and another time

292
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,210
with PwC to,

293
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,930
validate that this is at least

294
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,930
thirty percent of
your operating

295
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,770
expense just wasted. Right?

296
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,450
And we've allowed data to lose

297
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,725
consistency and
precision of meaning.

298
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:07,365
We've got it stuck
in these rigid,

299
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:09,365
ancient technology,

300
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,485
environments so that we can't

301
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,850
do what we need to in terms of

302
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,530
automation and
straight through

303
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,610
processing. We're not getting

304
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,195
leverage off of our expensive

305
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,635
technology investments.

306
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:25,515
We have these
complex analytical

307
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:26,935
models that,

308
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:28,930
we're just spending all this

309
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,610
time trying to
make sure the data

310
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,210
works and the models
don't match,

311
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,830
and we're running around doing

312
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,150
fire drills and putting
out brush fires.

313
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:37,605
And mostly we're missing

314
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:39,205
opportunities for
upselling and

315
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,665
cross selling and innovation.

316
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,180
We can't understand
context for

317
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,600
legal or for finance
or for marketing.

318
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,700
And, of course,

319
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,240
I'm in the financial
industry.

320
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,720
The regulators
have a hard time

321
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,725
unraveling
the aggregates because

322
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,005
they're trying to
feed different

323
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,985
models looking
at systemic risk

324
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,585
types of, applications.

325
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:03,380
The truth is not
gonna fix this

326
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,360
by continuing to do the same

327
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,220
thing over and over
and over again.

328
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,560
You're not gonna fix this by

329
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,060
adopting more
proprietary schemas,

330
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,685
managing that rigid pipeline,

331
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,885
or trying to force
fit data into

332
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,945
legacy data models that were

333
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:21,080
created for specific
applications.

334
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,180
We have to look at this thing

335
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,560
differently, which
is why I focus on,

336
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:29,785
these two concepts. Right?

337
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,305
I'm not gonna shy
away from them.

338
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:32,605
One is semantic.

339
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,205
It just says meaning,

340
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,765
and the other one
is standards.

341
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,960
So these are wonderful ideas.

342
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,080
We should not worry
about the the,

343
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,640
the dreaded o word of ontology

344
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,975
is a fantastic Let me see if I

345
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:51,595
can demystify this for you.

346
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:55,980
Starts with, four concepts,

347
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,840
four standards
concepts of which

348
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,020
is a scaffolding for
everything else.

349
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Right? And the first one,

350
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,695
the most important
one is the ability

351
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:09,255
to reconcile identity
against a single,

352
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,775
permanent, unique,

353
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,015
unchangeable identifier
in the cloud.

354
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,500
You know, it's a, you know,

355
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,440
individualized
resource identifier

356
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,440
or a resource locator.

357
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,800
Forget what it's called.

358
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:22,815
It is a ability
to have a single

359
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:25,675
precise granular
identifier for

360
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:28,770
everything to which
all of the other

361
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,690
systems get linked to. Right?

362
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,530
So you should think of this as

363
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,310
the Rosetta Stone capability

364
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,725
that allows you to not have to

365
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,805
move the data.
You just link it

366
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:43,185
up to its identity
in the cloud.

367
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,640
You combine that
with ontologies.

368
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,220
Right? So there there are two

369
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,180
sides of this coin.

370
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,935
First is, can we
model precision?

371
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,675
And and the answer
is yes. We can.

372
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:55,215
Right? We know how to capture

373
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:58,155
what subject matter
experts tell

374
00:13:58,155 --> 00:13:59,850
us to in the way things work,

375
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,710
boxes and line diagrams.

376
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,490
But the magic here is that we

377
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,070
can express it
now in standards

378
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,525
using the triples,
the other word,

379
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,305
the gift of the Department
of Defense.

380
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:13,885
Understanding triples is

381
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:15,580
straightforward.
Just recognize

382
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
that couple pair,

383
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,300
current relational technology

384
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,720
is location based. Right?

385
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,460
It's a column row
with tables,

386
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,565
joins, keys, and explicitly

387
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,445
defined relationships.

388
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:28,325
A triple is a sentence
structure.

389
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,905
Two nouns, they
call them subject

390
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,825
and object, linked by a verb

391
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:32,645
called a predicate.

392
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,760
All of those things
are precisely

393
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,080
defined at their most
granular level.

394
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,160
So they become building blocks

395
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,900
that you can then reuse for

396
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,815
applications because
they capture

397
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,615
concepts. It's
not necessary to

398
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:48,015
be an expert at how to write,

399
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,510
SPARQL queries, but,

400
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,270
you should
understand the basic

401
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,890
philosophy behind
how it works.

402
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,830
And then, of course,

403
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,750
the final part is
business rules

404
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,295
that are also, machine
executable in,

405
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:02,915
a semantic language.

406
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:05,715
So rules and
identity and meaning

407
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,475
come together. You
should remember

408
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:10,140
the semantic trinity. Right?

409
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,380
Identify, describe,
and express.

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,900
That's the goal.

411
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,580
With those standards,

412
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,745
we get these fantastic
capabilities.

413
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:22,305
Right? So the first one is,

414
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,405
quality by math. Right?

415
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:27,550
It's they're all
axiomatic statements,

416
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,070
and and if it doesn't match

417
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,530
the structure of
the ontology,

418
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,190
then it doesn't get imported

419
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,990
into the system.

420
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,230
So bad data cannot
get into your

421
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,110
system in the first place.

422
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,310
You're not running
around trying

423
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,695
to find it and clean it.

424
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:40,375
It's done automatically.

425
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:42,695
These are concepts.

426
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,995
They're like tinker
toy building

427
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,595
blocks that you just kind of

428
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,380
create and put together,

429
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,140
and you get to reuse them

430
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,740
application by application.

431
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,300
So you take identity
and meaning,

432
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:56,295
and you add to that time,

433
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,595
and you can express
almost every

434
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,295
context with those
three things.

435
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:01,955
And source is
important because

436
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:03,575
you want to make
sure the quality

437
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:07,150
of the data is fit for
its intended use.

438
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,830
Right? So this is all mostly

439
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,430
about describing the data,

440
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,570
not about the values.

441
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,805
Sometimes it's
critical for you

442
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,065
to multisource or triangulate

443
00:16:17,445 --> 00:16:19,125
to make sure that the value is

444
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,230
accurate as well.

445
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,730
With semantic standards,

446
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,030
we can and actually
because it's

447
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,250
linked to the identifier,

448
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,805
we can track it as it flows

449
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,105
across all of our systems,

450
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:32,585
goes through our
calculation engines.

451
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,885
We can, manage our,

452
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:37,305
privacy and our
security concerns.

453
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,010
We can prove to our,

454
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,670
auditors that we know,

455
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,690
how it flows and
we have a control

456
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,665
environment. Governance,

457
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:49,065
which is mostly about quality

458
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:51,865
and definition and
requirements capture,

459
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,305
is all done automatically.

460
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,065
So governance
becomes simplified

461
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,630
and valuable. Right?

462
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,010
It's not onerous governance.

463
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,270
It is what do you
need and let's

464
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,545
go focus on getting it and and

465
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:07,265
integrating it
into our semantic

466
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:10,125
environment. It's all
machine readable,

467
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,885
so humans can understand it as

468
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:12,785
well as machines,

469
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,650
and it's done on
a continuously

470
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,110
tested basis. So
there's no big

471
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,950
bang releases that you have to

472
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,970
worry about. You
can add modular

473
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,825
components, and they're always

474
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,205
continually tested of whether

475
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:27,685
it is logically valid or of

476
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:28,825
the right structure.

477
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,010
So with those capabilities,

478
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,630
there are kinda
two things that

479
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,350
I look at.

480
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,530
One is why we do it,

481
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:38,725
and the other one
is what we do.

482
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,245
And these kinda cross
over each other.

483
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:41,765
Right? And we do this for

484
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:42,805
straightforward
reasons. Right?

485
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:44,825
We wanna operate efficiently.

486
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,460
We wanna automate
our processes.

487
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,620
We wanna make
sure that we have

488
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,120
control over
the data for privacy

489
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,600
and for, regulatory
compliance.

490
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:56,355
We wanna give our
data scientists

491
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,675
flexibility to follow
their intuition.

492
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:01,720
We wanna be able to
link up products,

493
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,940
transactions, and customers so

494
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,780
we can upsell and
cross sell our

495
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,340
activities. We we do that by

496
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,800
building connected
inventories,

497
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,385
by facilitating
the integration

498
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,385
of data across our
organization,

499
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,565
and by managing the access to

500
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:20,190
the data at a data
point level,

501
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,290
not a system level,
a data level,

502
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,090
so that we are
ensured of privacy,

503
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,250
management constraints.

504
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,415
Let me drill down to this just

505
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:31,635
a little bit deeper.

506
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,955
So I think this is
really the essence

507
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,495
of the business value side of

508
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:38,070
the business. Right?

509
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,770
And we'll do this
in the standard

510
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,610
three c's of cost,
capability,

511
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,090
and control. So as
I said before,

512
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,015
this is about thirty percent

513
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,075
savings minimum,

514
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,535
because we've
standardized meaning

515
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:51,455
and standard identity and we

516
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:52,995
have the entitlement control,

517
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,490
Integration becomes
simplified.

518
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,050
We can, get rid of redundant

519
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,370
systems and consolidate
activities,

520
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,655
and we can achieve
automation.

521
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,235
So the cost savings alone are

522
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,915
overwhelming. But, really,

523
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:08,535
we're doing this
to facilitate,

524
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,390
innovation. Right?

525
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,830
We wanna make sure that our

526
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,550
analysts can
follow the what if

527
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,710
scenarios that are required so

528
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,490
we can test out ideas.

529
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,035
We wanna be able to look at

530
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,655
things from different
perspectives,

531
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:23,015
and we don't wanna be,

532
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:24,855
forced to have to restructure

533
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:27,230
data just to look at
it from a different

534
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,330
view, like a risk risk view,

535
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,550
not the same thing
as a legal view,

536
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,230
not the same thing as
a financial view,

537
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,470
not the same thing as
a marketing view,

538
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,255
not the same thing as
a regulatory view.

539
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:39,335
We should be able
to look at all

540
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:39,915
of that,

541
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:43,115
by asking questions
of the data

542
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,740
rather than
restructuring its,

543
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,200
its format.

544
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,700
And then the goal
is to establish

545
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,820
what the regulators in our

546
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,920
industry called,
a control environment,

547
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,585
which is defined, attract,

548
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,045
with systems of
record so we can

549
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:01,345
comply with our obligations,

550
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,165
so we can aggregate things on

551
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,430
a consistent basis across our

552
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,530
organization. So when
you look at that,

553
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,970
it's kind of an overwhelming
value side.

554
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,005
But there's a cost
associated.

555
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:13,725
There are challenges,

556
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,085
and and we have to be honest

557
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:17,805
about the challenges
as well. Right?

558
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,165
So let's take a look at this

559
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,150
idea of data centric,

560
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,750
and and I think
a lot about this.

561
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,950
I'm, like, wondering,
you know,

562
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,310
what exactly does it mean?

563
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,045
So I stole this quote.

564
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:30,725
I think sums it up
properly. Right?

565
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:32,185
It's not about
the technology.

566
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:34,665
This technology works
as advertised.

567
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,180
This is about cognition and

568
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,620
understanding and making sure

569
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,100
that people get the joke and

570
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,480
believe in the possibility.

571
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,840
Because once you do that,

572
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,795
it becomes obvious
that this is

573
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:47,175
the way we should be operating

574
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:47,895
our organization.

575
00:20:48,995 --> 00:20:50,375
In order to do that,

576
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:54,090
we have to manage
two critical,

577
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,210
inhibitors to adoption.

578
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,430
And the first one
is really to full.

579
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,865
Right? It's what I'll call in

580
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:03,325
organizational inertia.

581
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:05,385
Because not only
do you have to

582
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:08,525
have this data centric
orientation of,

583
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,910
why we have incongruence and

584
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,730
the implications,

585
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,750
but you have to be able to,

586
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,330
manage the organizational

587
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,195
challenges of priorities and

588
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:24,215
politics and
processes and give

589
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:26,135
appropriate air cover and and

590
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:28,670
allow for
the infrastructure to

591
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,090
be created,
meaning coordination

592
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,230
across your processes and

593
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,370
facilitating collaboration.

594
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,185
It's a big ask. We know that.

595
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:37,865
But this is really the big

596
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,265
challenge is it's not really

597
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:40,925
the technology.

598
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:45,330
There is some
transformation costs.

599
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,270
Right? You do have to have,

600
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,950
triple store triple stores and

601
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,470
and the tool sets.

602
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,375
There is a skill
set requirements.

603
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:58,015
You must build
the ontologies correctly,

604
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:01,900
manage pipeline from
ingestion through,

605
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,480
application. So
this is the this

606
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
is the other side
of the coin,

607
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,115
and it's a real
side of the coin.

608
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:11,835
Mostly compounded
by what I call

609
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:14,395
the four horsemen of the data

610
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:15,615
management apocalypse.

611
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,430
Ignorance, arrogance,
obsolescence,

612
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,470
and power.

613
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:25,475
And we all know,

614
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:28,255
they run rampant through lots

615
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:28,915
of organizations,

616
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:31,055
and we have to kind of,

617
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:33,380
manage this organizational

618
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
challenge because
we're talking

619
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,480
about thinking about
data in a different

620
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,285
way. So we paint
you a composite

621
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:45,085
picture, and it starts with

622
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:46,765
let's call this
the infrastructure,

623
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,345
and the most important one is

624
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:50,450
this information
literacy concept

625
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,570
of understanding
the problem and

626
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,410
what it means, and why data

627
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,950
meaning is not
data processing,

628
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,390
and why this is
not a technology

629
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,565
problem, and the possibilities

630
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:05,105
of fixing this,
adopting standards,

631
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,240
doing appropriate
data hygiene.

632
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,260
You know, regardless
of how you do this,

633
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,640
whether you do a conventional

634
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,840
technology or semantic,

635
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:16,545
you have to manage the hygiene

636
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,305
of your data. If you're going

637
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:19,525
to do all that work,

638
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:20,725
do it strategically.

639
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,260
And that makes
sure that we have

640
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,640
to deal with, organizational,

641
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,240
dysfunction and
and, you know,

642
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,695
I've been tracking
data manager

643
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:32,155
for a while, and I call this

644
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:34,235
little g governance
in data management.

645
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:35,435
We're doing that pretty well.

646
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:36,975
We've learned
a lot about that.

647
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:38,955
But big g governance
of getting

648
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:41,650
the organization
to adopt a way

649
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,470
of thinking,

650
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,330
is the challenge that senior

651
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,070
execs are responsible
for implementing.

652
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:49,845
There are some requirements.

653
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,425
You know, as I said,

654
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:53,525
cognition and buy
in is critical.

655
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:55,045
Air cover is critical.

656
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,950
Understanding why
we have a problem

657
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,770
and the implications,

658
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,950
being able to to think of this

659
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,050
strategically, not
just tactically,

660
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:07,175
you know, fix the problem once

661
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,715
and get it off our plate.

662
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:14,075
Please, adopt this
idea of the semantic

663
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:17,080
trinity of identify,
describe,

664
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,840
and express. Right?

665
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,400
Identifiers, common meaning,

666
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,395
standards expression
with an accountability

667
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:27,335
and policy framework
around it that,

668
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:29,675
helps us with our
ecosystem management.

669
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,830
And then there are
three big areas.

670
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,010
Right? First one is
the architecture.

671
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,910
We talked a little
bit about this.

672
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,770
Right? Identity and
meaning resolution,

673
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:40,685
expressed in standards with

674
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,145
executable business rules,

675
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:43,585
and managing the pipeline,

676
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:45,885
which is itself
a challenge. Right?

677
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,745
You have to manage
it differently

678
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,630
in a semantic world,
to be able to,

679
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,470
you know, triple
ify it, you know,

680
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,310
turn it into triples and align

681
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,530
it with just the ontologies.

682
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:58,525
The business case must be made

683
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:00,705
over and over again to
all the appropriate

684
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,085
stakeholders. We have to think

685
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,980
about them from
the building blocks.

686
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,940
Right? You know,

687
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,020
that is identity
and meaning and

688
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,800
time and source
giving us context,

689
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,730
mathematical quality
value validation,

690
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:17,455
reusability of
our concepts and

691
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:18,735
how what does it
mean to manage

692
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:20,915
in a conceptual
data environment,

693
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:22,995
and traceability from,

694
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,810
through all
the transformations.

695
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,810
The audit is very
happy about that.

696
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,390
The business case of
the big three c's,

697
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,250
right, cost, capability,
and control,

698
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,735
plus the language of,

699
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,895
business in terms
of measurement

700
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:40,235
criteria. Right?

701
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,075
Efficiency of use and user

702
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,460
experience and
time to market,

703
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,660
and we can prove all this.

704
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,120
And we spend a lot of time

705
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,860
worrying about
the measurement criteria,

706
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,360
which I'm happy
to share against

707
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,735
the cost of
conversion. Right?

708
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:55,275
The inertia of our
organization.

709
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,095
This is all real
stuff. Right?

710
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:59,515
The physical
infrastructure and

711
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,080
transformation
we have to do to

712
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,260
map from conventional
to semantic.

713
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,960
And then there is an operating

714
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
model that, is required.

715
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,075
This is the data
hygiene operating

716
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,055
model, if you will.

717
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:14,955
But I've simplified
this. Right?

718
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:16,555
So the first part
of this is to

719
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:17,855
document what exists.

720
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,270
Build your inventory,

721
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,350
understand the data flow,

722
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,790
manage your lineage,

723
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,030
then you simplify all that,

724
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:27,945
authorize domains, names,

725
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:31,005
systems of records,
provisioning points,

726
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,085
classification of
what's important,

727
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,940
and data architecture,

728
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,560
capturing business
concepts and

729
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,500
translating them
into data concepts.

730
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,165
Let's not underestimate
the value

731
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,785
of this, the importance
of this.

732
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,185
Governance is required.

733
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:47,765
It's gonna be light touch,

734
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,445
but you're gonna
have roles and

735
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:52,530
skills and and policies
and, you know,

736
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,390
appropriate funding and

737
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,290
prioritization management and

738
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,550
escalation processes
and all that stuff.

739
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:01,575
And then how we
talk about it.

740
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:03,255
We talk about it
differently to

741
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,935
business, you know,
time to market,

742
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:07,130
use cases versus technology,

743
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,710
which is about integration and

744
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,190
scalability and
resiliency versus

745
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,970
control functions
about transparency

746
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,290
and traceability
and auditability.

747
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:18,175
So this is,

748
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,735
emphasizing
the importance of,

749
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:23,640
education and
messaging because

750
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,120
buy in is the fundamental task

751
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,920
if you're going to go
in this direction.

752
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,480
So here's some
concluding thoughts.

753
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,365
First, implementing a semantic

754
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:37,145
environment can be
done incrementally,

755
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:39,940
use case by use case. Right?

756
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,900
Which is that and that that

757
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,180
would be the way
you would do it,

758
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,540
and I would be
happy to talk to

759
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,080
you about what the appropriate

760
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,900
priorities are and how you

761
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,880
implement that.

762
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:51,615
There is a foundational
level level.

763
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,175
If the engineer
does correctly,

764
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:56,015
these are concepts,

765
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,050
and and we have to be able to

766
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,510
capture things like,

767
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,010
obligation and commitment and

768
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,110
control and party and role.

769
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:07,725
Then you and engineering that

770
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,325
is critical because this is

771
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,005
the scaffolding from which we

772
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,065
build the rest.

773
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,610
There is some investment.
It's not huge.

774
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,990
This is not a rip
and replace,

775
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,650
but there is some
investment in

776
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,410
technology. The
good news is it

777
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,090
plays nice with all of your

778
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,535
existing environments.

779
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:28,735
You do have to make
a transition,

780
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:30,895
and business value
is not always

781
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,970
immediately known
from the first

782
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:34,790
use case,

783
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,850
but all the rest of the use

784
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,390
cases become a lot easier.

785
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,935
So a little bit of
patience is required.

786
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:44,615
That's why leadership
is critical,

787
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:46,620
like finding
the right sponsor,

788
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,720
providing the appropriate
air cover,

789
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,640
you know,
organizational challenges

790
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,100
are necessary,
including the right

791
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,760
team leader for your
semantic journey.

792
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:57,695
And then process. Right?

793
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,835
This is a ability
to engineer,

794
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:04,595
test, add, test,

795
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,420
have policies test.

796
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,100
Those are all critical.

797
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,915
I will make these
slides available.

798
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,695
I did a good big
Ben Franklin,

799
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:17,315
cost benefit. They're both

800
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:18,595
legitimate size. Right?

801
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,375
I think the drivers
are overwhelming,

802
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,710
and this is a strategic value

803
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,630
that I would,
encourage everybody

804
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,970
to consider. But managing

805
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,835
organizational
cohesion is not,

806
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:34,335
an insignificant problem.
So this is me.

807
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,620
By all means, reach out.

808
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,380
I'm making this
course available

809
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,040
through my friends
at the Knowledge

810
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,860
Graph Conference.

811
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,605
Joaquin Melara is the CLL.

812
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:46,025
He's been terrific in helping

813
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,325
me get this organized.

814
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:49,305
So thank you for
your attention,

815
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:50,925
and, good luck to you.
