00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,200
Hi. I'm David Newman.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,480
I'm going to introduce you to

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,265
enterprise knowledge
graph capabilities.

4
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:20,725
First of all, let me,

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,950
describe this from a very high

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,590
perspective. New frontiers and

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,450
innovation require investments

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,510
in new foundational
building blocks.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,705
For example, the mapping of

10
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:34,565
the human genome is
a representation

11
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,745
of a first of
a kind model that's

12
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,030
a prerequisite step
in innovations.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,990
Secondly, novel technologies

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,770
must be developed
that know how

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,350
to effectively
exploit the model,

16
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:51,195
such as DNA
sequencing technologies

17
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:55,175
that developed to
exploit the mapping

18
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,395
of the human genome,

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,130
and their focus is
on reintegrating

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,870
fragmented parts
of DNA so that

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,970
novel innovations could emerge

22
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:08,265
that reflect
critical breakthroughs

23
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:12,665
such as, the mRNA,
vaccines for COVID,

24
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,440
cancer genomics,
personalized medicine.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,280
Similarly, in finance,

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,105
we're doing the same
basic process

27
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,665
to innovate new capabilities.

28
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:28,185
In this case,

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,720
we're mapping the financial

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,420
genome using knowledge graph

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,040
models called ontologies,

32
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,135
and new technologies
have emerged

33
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,615
to exploit these very powerful

34
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,175
representational models.

35
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,610
Knowledge graph technologies

36
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,450
focus on reintegrating
the fragmented

37
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,810
parts of data.

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,730
Examples of technologies,

39
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:56,135
that we need to exploit for

40
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,735
knowledge graph are graph and

41
00:01:57,735 --> 00:01:59,595
virtual graph databases,

42
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:01,835
knowledge driven
data catalogs,

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,390
and data fabrics, and
graph algorithms,

44
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,310
and graph neural networks,

45
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,750
just to name a few.

46
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,195
And these will result in some

47
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:12,175
new innovations,

48
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:16,495
such as advanced ways
of understanding,

49
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,920
customer, customer
three sixty,

50
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,640
ways to better, solve
financial crimes,

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,665
make risk more
visible to better

52
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,825
manage it, improvements in

53
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:32,205
regulatory compliance,

54
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:35,550
and significant
improvements in

55
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,530
data management.

56
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,150
Knowledge graph
is really the way

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,290
forward for data.

58
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,930
So let's look at this chart.

59
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:44,835
At the bottom are things that

60
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,055
humans can understand,

61
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:48,115
and at the top are things that

62
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:49,335
machines can understand.

63
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:53,450
In parallel is
the expressivity

64
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,450
of the information model.

65
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,770
The more expressive
the information

66
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,470
model, the more powerful will

67
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,765
its linkage and insights be.

68
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,405
So let's look at this
chronologically.

69
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,725
So around nineteen seventy,

70
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,625
the relational model,

71
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,110
the prevailing model
today emerged,

72
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,870
which focuses on looking at,

73
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,150
columns and tables,
which describes,

74
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,335
basically,
information in terms

75
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,375
of strings or numbers that are

76
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,880
represented as
attributes within

77
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,960
entities, relational databases

78
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,520
emerged in around
nineteen eighty five.

79
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,220
Fast forward to
the twenty first

80
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,805
century with the emergence of

81
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:40,745
knowledge graph models
and databases,

82
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,305
we could look at this area as

83
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,350
a subset of
artificial intelligence

84
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,910
known as
knowledge representation

85
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,470
and reasoning or ontologies,

86
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,395
which looks at data as things

87
00:03:58,695 --> 00:03:59,815
and not as strings.

88
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:02,395
So looking at this, graph,

89
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,030
data is look is looked at as

90
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,510
first class objects
or nodes in

91
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,970
the graph that are associated

92
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,135
with other nodes
in a graph that

93
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:14,595
reflect relationships.

94
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,975
That's what these
lines or edges are,

95
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,915
and more about that later.

96
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,195
So around two
thousand and twelve,

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,260
knowledge graph models and

98
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,640
databases were
able to converge

99
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,255
with machine learning where we

100
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:33,275
can leverage new analytic

101
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,975
capabilities in
this area called

102
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,275
knowledge graph completion,

103
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:41,000
where the algorithms converge

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,180
with the knowledge
graph database

105
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,580
can infer new relationships,

106
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,820
new linkages,
link prediction,

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,195
classification, categorization

108
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:54,835
in order to create
new nodes and

109
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,535
create linkages between these

110
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:00,000
nodes to reflect
new insights.

111
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,040
And then we can further evolve

112
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,500
forward around
two thousand and

113
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,315
sixteen with the emergence of

114
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:09,615
graph neural networks,

115
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,015
which represent
the intersection

116
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,235
of knowledge
representation and

117
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,335
reasoning with
machine learning,

118
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,550
deep learning, and natural

119
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,970
language processing
to generate

120
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,310
what we would call knowledge

121
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,130
graph embeddings or
vectorized things,

122
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,225
which are ways of
representing,

123
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,225
very concrete pieces
of information

124
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,785
alternatively in,

125
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,050
numeric representation
or vector

126
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,630
representation so
that it aligns

127
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,830
much better with
machine learning

128
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,075
algorithms in order to apply,

129
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:46,675
new techniques,

130
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:50,735
new analytic
techniques that can,

131
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,230
understand and
express data that

132
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,770
would otherwise be represented

133
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,690
in a more
conventional database

134
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,490
in order to gain new insights

135
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,205
in very precise
ways of clustering

136
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:07,965
information. And
this ultimately is,

137
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:09,565
right now,

138
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,840
a way for machines
to understand

139
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,160
information that humans could

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,060
also understand.

141
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,740
So knowledge graph
really is a strategic

142
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,740
capability that transcends

143
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,185
relational data capabilities.

144
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:26,585
So when we look
at the prevailing

145
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,505
relational data paradigm,

146
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,565
one of the things that really

147
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:33,310
stands out is
what I would call

148
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,130
it duality or dualistic,

149
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,270
scenarios where the model is

150
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,935
segregated from
the physical model,

151
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,175
which is segregated
from the metadata,

152
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:46,655
which is segregated
from the data.

153
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,235
These are all separate.

154
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:51,860
These are all,
nonintegratable.

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
So this also results in,

156
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,105
tremendous incongruency and

157
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:01,585
fragmentation,
which results in

158
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,925
a lot of data
management problems,

159
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:06,005
a lot of, complexity,

160
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:09,210
a lot of limitations in what

161
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,910
the prevailing relational
paradigm can,

162
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,530
actually achieve in terms of

163
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,275
what we really need
to, to support the,

164
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,895
you know, very complex
data needs today.

165
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,780
So the emergence
of the knowledge

166
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,300
graph paradigm
positions us much

167
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,625
better for the future
because data,

168
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:39,045
because the data
the model around

169
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:41,765
that data plus metadata plus

170
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:44,590
knowledge are all linked and

171
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,710
integrated together.

172
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,090
So I call this nondualistic.

173
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,010
They're not segregated.

174
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,865
They're integrated
in a way that

175
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:57,085
allows us to connect data to

176
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,525
knowledge about that data.

177
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:02,090
It's connected
through this new

178
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,110
paradigm rather
than segregated

179
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,030
in a relational paradigm.

180
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,830
So the ability
to actually link

181
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,505
knowledge to raw data,

182
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:13,185
and I'll explain that a little

183
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:16,325
further on, is a is
a huge achievement.

184
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,670
So linking the data
to its model,

185
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,870
to its metadata,

186
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,270
and knowledge about that data

187
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,570
is gonna stimulate
some very new

188
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,045
innovations and tremendous

189
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:28,025
business value.

190
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,645
Well, let's dive
into first what

191
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,325
a graph is so we could better

192
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,265
understand what
a knowledge graph is.

193
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,590
So a graph is a unique form of

194
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,170
data organization
that describes

195
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,010
networks of connected data.

196
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,795
So we can look at this,

197
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:47,575
example here of
a network or a graph,

198
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:50,775
which is reflected with nodes

199
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,820
connected to other
nodes by these lines,

200
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,180
which we call edges.

201
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,240
These are connectors.

202
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:01,065
For example, we could say that

203
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:04,165
person a is a node,
person b, c,

204
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,265
and d are examples of nodes.

205
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,390
And we can label
the edges, with the,

206
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,150
predicate pays,

207
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,870
and we could then
get a visualization

208
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,435
at a at a data structure that

209
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:20,935
indicates that person a pays

210
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,175
both person b and c,

211
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,440
and b and c both
pay person d.

212
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
And this is a very
powerful data

213
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,100
structure that can
be used to reflect,

214
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,580
use cases such as,

215
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:36,485
anti money laundering,

216
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:38,085
payments networks,

217
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,645
ways of better
detecting fraud,

218
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,945
technology asset
management, where,

219
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:45,050
again, the basic organization

220
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,110
of the data for the use cases

221
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,770
and network.

222
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,050
So so the idea here is to use

223
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,065
a data organization
that better

224
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,225
reflects the use case than

225
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,645
alternatively
slicing and dicing

226
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,370
this into tabular views that

227
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,630
don't reflect this
holistic picture.

228
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,010
So what is a knowledge graph?

229
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,810
So a knowledge graph is a very

230
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,935
highly expressive form of data

231
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,455
organized in a graph,

232
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,515
except that
the knowledge graph

233
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,175
allows us to describe concepts

234
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,260
that describe
the data itself.

235
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,720
And this representation of

236
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,175
concepts in a logical model is

237
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,715
also known as an ontology.

238
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:29,635
It's a way of representing

239
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,475
knowledge and
describing meaning.

240
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:34,595
A very standardized form of

241
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,030
representing ontologies in is

242
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,650
a language called RDFOWL,

243
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,810
and it's the global semantic

244
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,010
modeling standard.

245
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:45,515
It's the a modeling standard

246
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,855
that's best used to represent

247
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,275
knowledge graphs because it's

248
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,895
of its expressivity,

249
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,470
and it's
linguistically aligned

250
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,930
with how we think and speak.

251
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,790
And, basically,

252
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,470
what this will do is allow us

253
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,050
to take unstructured content

254
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,815
definitions and translate it

255
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:04,495
into a structured
form that not

256
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,875
only humans can understand,

257
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,555
but machines can understand.

258
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:08,835
So as an example,

259
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:10,490
we could describe
a model where

260
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,470
we have a customer,

261
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,090
associated with
a checking account

262
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,630
and a credit card account,

263
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,515
and we have this
notion of this

264
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,695
edge that we could label with

265
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,075
the meaning has
account so that

266
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,375
this is very intuitively

267
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,135
understandable to a human.

268
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,610
We can describe concepts and

269
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,430
other concepts and
the and the linkage

270
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,570
of these is what we would call

271
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,815
a predicate. And
these could be

272
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,215
further defined in a very rich

273
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,475
taxonomy where we
could describe

274
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:41,975
that checking and credit card

275
00:11:41,975 --> 00:11:44,075
accounts are kinds
of accounts,

276
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,580
and that checking and credit

277
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,500
card accounts also have common

278
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,800
behaviors or attributes.

279
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,260
In this case, they both share

280
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,015
common behavior that they will

281
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:56,915
have transactions
that associate

282
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,835
to another first class object

283
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,115
called the transaction,

284
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,520
which will also have a fan out

285
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,860
of relationships that describe

286
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,620
the meaning of
the transaction,

287
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,565
that it's meaningful
in that a transaction

288
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,145
may reflect the purchase from

289
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,165
a merchant, and it may reflect

290
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,525
the purchase amount,

291
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:17,525
which is some monetary value.

292
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,290
And that this
could be all again

293
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,470
represented using
a standardized

294
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,850
common semantic language like

295
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,185
RDFOWL that is also
highly reusable,

296
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:30,185
which we'll describe
a little more,

297
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:32,565
in a moment, and
it's something

298
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,565
that humans and machines can

299
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:35,385
both understand.

300
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,880
So a knowledge graph elevated

301
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,260
to an enterprise level
is an enterprise

302
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,080
knowledge graph,

303
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,980
and this is where
the knowledge

304
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,880
graph model,

305
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,265
is standardized and is highly

306
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,525
reusable across
the enterprise,

307
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,545
and it organically
grows bottom

308
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:57,250
up from use cases where new

309
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,930
business elements and,

310
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,230
business behaviors
are represented

311
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,195
in this model that
has enterprise

312
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,515
reuse reusability capability.

313
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:11,970
And this also,
positions us for,

314
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,770
leveraging a common semantic

315
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,790
language across the enterprise

316
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,970
for better,

317
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,435
data integration
as well as for

318
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:24,695
improved
interoperability because

319
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,395
this knowledge graph model

320
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:28,635
leverages open web protocols.

321
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,930
So essentially, we're
superimposing the,

322
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,970
power and behavior
of the Internet

323
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,545
across our data
and the ability

324
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,705
to link data and
information in

325
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:41,965
the Internet is
very similar to

326
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:43,885
how we link and integrate data

327
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:46,370
across an enterprise
knowledge graph.

328
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,210
So let's take the model we

329
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,910
described a little
bit earlier,

330
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,935
and we can now introduce data

331
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:56,995
to that model where
we can execute

332
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,115
new transactions
for in this case,

333
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,600
a customer has
a consumer credit

334
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,680
card account where
there are one

335
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,160
to many transactions that all

336
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,745
fan out to
the same standardized

337
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,105
description of
data that reflects

338
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,745
transactions, monetary values

339
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:17,345
associated with merchants,

340
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,410
and this fan out
can further occur.

341
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,590
Now with the semantic web,

342
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,330
what we're doing is we're

343
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,775
prelinking
information together

344
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:30,895
using the fan out of the,

345
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,955
web of data that
all aligns with

346
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,735
a common conceptual model,

347
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,800
and we can ask
certain questions.

348
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,120
So we may ask a,

349
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,600
some information
about a merchant,

350
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,000
and we may ask for
a given merchant,

351
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,865
who are the customers across

352
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,105
the enterprise that interface

353
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,365
with this merchant even though

354
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,470
some of the customers are

355
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,390
domiciled in
different lines of

356
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,410
businesses. So for example,

357
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,790
consumer credit card line of

358
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,330
business may have different,

359
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:06,985
databases than the consumer

360
00:15:06,985 --> 00:15:08,585
debit card line of business or

361
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:10,345
the commercial card line of

362
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,945
business or
the business credit

363
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,085
card line of business.

364
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,380
But if these databases are

365
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,280
represented semantically as

366
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,400
graph databases,

367
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,645
then we will be
able to, engineer,

368
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,285
federation
and interoperability

369
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,825
across these databases because

370
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:31,610
we all aligned to
the same common

371
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,950
model and the same web enabled

372
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,350
protocols where
we could simply

373
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,750
ask a question of a merchant,

374
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:43,005
and that question
will traverse these,

375
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:46,105
web enabled interfaces and

376
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:49,100
linkages over the web of data

377
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,180
in order to basically,

378
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,275
identify that the ultimate

379
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,615
customers associated with this

380
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:02,335
merchant can be
identified even

381
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,970
though they may be,

382
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,610
stored in different databases

383
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,370
across the enterprise.

384
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,810
So we could better enable

385
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,685
enterprise linkage
using the semantic

386
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:18,205
web, and the web protocol for

387
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,325
advanced interoperability.

388
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,110
So, one more,

389
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,970
point I wanna
make here is that

390
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,510
knowledge graph can apply

391
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,045
knowledge to data in order to

392
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,985
infer new insights
and relationships.

393
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,285
For example, the concept of

394
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,040
corporate control, Again,

395
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,340
it's broken down
into this notion

396
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,180
of subject,
predicate, object,

397
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,620
which again is linguistically

398
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,995
aligned with how we
think and speak.

399
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,755
So let's take this example.

400
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,375
A corporation is an example of

401
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,940
a subject, controls
another corporation,

402
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,500
predicate, and another object

403
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,240
represents this concept of

404
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,825
corporate control.

405
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,045
And then we can weave more

406
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:03,065
specificity into this concept

407
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,945
by saying that
controls majority

408
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,950
voting shares is
a kind of controls.

409
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,470
We can add more
specificity to subjects,

410
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,750
predicates, and objects.

411
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,995
And then we can introduce data

412
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,835
and link it to the model where

413
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:20,335
we could say that
Global Bank,

414
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,575
a data assertion,

415
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,415
is a type of a corporation,

416
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,680
and New York Bank is a type of

417
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,440
corporation. Now
once we've done

418
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,620
this and this is
actually a significant

419
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,500
leap because within
knowledge graph,

420
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,815
data and the metadata
around it

421
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,895
and the conceptual
model around

422
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,595
that can all be interlinked

423
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,355
within the web.

424
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,270
So it's all operationalized.

425
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,450
We can then say
that Global Bank,

426
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,590
a type of corporation,

427
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,470
controls the majority voting

428
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:54,265
shares of New York Bank.

429
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:57,305
And then we can also introduce

430
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:00,280
additional concepts that is

431
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,140
majority controlled by,

432
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,540
is the inverse of controls

433
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,960
majority voting shares.

434
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,880
They're the polar opposites of

435
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,400
each other, and we
could introduce

436
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,765
this into our model.

437
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,345
And now you can see we're

438
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,105
introducing some
knowledge into

439
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,185
the model by virtue of how we

440
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:17,245
introduce concepts.

441
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,190
And then we may be able to say

442
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,090
that New York Bank,
because it,

443
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,305
is, has its major
is controlled

444
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,485
by Global Bank.

445
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:30,165
Global Bank controls
the majority

446
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,945
voting shares of
New York Bank.

447
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,520
Therefore, New York Bank is

448
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,600
majority controlled
by Global Bank.

449
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,980
We could draw that inference.

450
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,120
And then we could further draw

451
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,995
the inference that
once we model

452
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:45,215
that a parent company,

453
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,915
and a subsidiary company have

454
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,680
a relationship such
that the subsidiary

455
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,580
company is majority controlled

456
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,400
by the parent
company given that

457
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,620
New York Bank must
play the role

458
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,320
of the subsidiary company,

459
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:01,715
and Global Bank
must play the role

460
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:03,015
of the parent company.

461
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:04,775
And these are very powerful

462
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:07,175
inferences that we could make

463
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,180
by linking the data
to the concepts,

464
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,100
establishing and defining

465
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,780
knowledge about
those concepts.

466
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,815
And the knowledge
really emerges

467
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,335
when we draw these inferences

468
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,875
to basically infer that Global

469
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,735
Bank must be a parent company

470
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:24,975
and New York Bank must be

471
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,990
subsidiary company
of Global Bank.

472
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,030
And having this data linked to

473
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,490
concept and
knowledge is really

474
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,185
a very powerful enabler and

475
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,585
bridge to more
advanced machine

476
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:40,445
learning and the introduction

477
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,170
of more precise, insights.

478
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,150
So with that, I'm gonna turn

479
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,490
the presentation over
to my colleague,

480
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,850
Omar Khan, to
continue with his,

481
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:52,655
part of the presentation.

482
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,095
Thank you very much.

483
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,225
Hi. Thanks for
joining David and

484
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,905
me today to talk
about the enterprise

485
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:09,725
knowledge graph.

486
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:11,705
I'd like to talk a little bit

487
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:13,145
about the current
unlinked data

488
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,340
environment and
how adding linked

489
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,540
data approaches will help with

490
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,700
better integration
with an easier

491
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,840
infrastructure consolidation.

492
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,980
So when you have a linked data

493
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,835
environment, what that allows

494
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:26,015
you to do is have
various views

495
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:27,875
so that you can have the view

496
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,015
of the data if it's
materialized,

497
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,415
or you can have
it run ad hoc.

498
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,610
For example, if you
see the banking

499
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,430
data here,

500
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,490
it's named with
various different

501
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,890
names and different silos for

502
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,950
for Acme Widgets.

503
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,315
However, when we
go to take a look

504
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:45,095
at the data in
a federated view,

505
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,810
what we see is we
can pull these

506
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,730
names together and work with

507
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,810
them with ease without having

508
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,270
to go across
different systems.

509
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,570
This provides you
with a common

510
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,815
query facade that
you could use

511
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,295
with RESTful APIs,
SQL, SPARQL,

512
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,055
or GraphQL. This could be used

513
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,770
to feed a dedicated EKG.

514
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,730
Moving on to the next slide.

515
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:14,825
If you have an,

516
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:16,525
enterprise knowledge graph,

517
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,185
you could do
something even more

518
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,110
powerful. You could tie in

519
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,030
question answering mechanisms

520
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,650
where it uses natural language

521
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,830
where you built a model that

522
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,530
humans can use to
perform inquiries.

523
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:28,555
One thing I believe will be

524
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,395
emerging is where instead of

525
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:31,835
creating specific restful

526
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,935
interfaces or other
sorts of APIs,

527
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,700
you will in fact
be using a bot

528
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,840
using natural
language that will

529
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,680
talk to the knowledge
graph and

530
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,540
get information
out of it based

531
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,695
off of question and
answering models.

532
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:46,535
Of course, there'll
be security

533
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:48,355
issues in which such coarse

534
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,295
grained facilities exist.

535
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,220
The other major
benefit of having

536
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,600
an enterprise knowledge graph

537
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,420
is you could find
out what sort

538
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,640
of concepts are similar.

539
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,195
For example, we
had Acme Widgets

540
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,215
Corporation, Acme Widgets,

541
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,295
Acme Widgets Incorporated,

542
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,860
and Acme Widgets
Incorporated.

543
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,880
They're spelled
different ways,

544
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
but the reality is they're

545
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,780
equivalent to the same thing.

546
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:17,645
In the previous slide,

547
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:19,325
you saw we we had linked data

548
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:20,205
that gave you the ability to

549
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,685
perform federation
amongst the data

550
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,360
that exist. However,

551
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,720
it didn't provide a model that

552
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,460
gave similarity.

553
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,840
It's true you could get a lot

554
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,340
of value by by mapping
and conventions.

555
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:33,165
That said,

556
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:35,865
what we could do
is apply vector

557
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:38,025
based models on
top of the data,

558
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,565
which would give us
enhanced similarity.

559
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,270
A lot of the recipe is taking

560
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,490
relationships and text,

561
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,470
creating chains of concepts

562
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,930
within that the graph,

563
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:49,465
and then seeing
what is similar,

564
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,045
making the matrix values that

565
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,185
could be run with mathematical

566
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,620
algorithms. So using graph

567
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,980
embeddings and neural network

568
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,900
based models would give you

569
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,440
additional lift from
the transformation.

570
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,660
You want to be sure, though,

571
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,120
to train the model correctly.

572
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:09,145
My shirt says
a clockwork onion.

573
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:12,025
It should say
a clockwork orange,

574
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:14,185
but it says
a clockwork onion.

575
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,270
So the the the computer split

576
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,790
this out wrong with a bad

577
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,850
similarity model,

578
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,650
or the human input
the data incorrectly?

579
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:23,185
It doesn't matter.

580
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:26,605
You need to look
at the data in

581
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,305
the knowledge graph
and the models,

582
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:30,945
and that's example
possible results.

583
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
You could also
perform all sorts

584
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,480
of visualizations
with your your

585
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,940
with your knowledge graph.

586
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,585
However, you probably don't

587
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:44,385
wanna overwhelm
the person who's

588
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:45,825
looking at the graph with too

589
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:46,565
much information.

590
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,630
Instead, really
focus on providing

591
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,310
a user interface as meaningful

592
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,630
to them and can
be exploratory.

593
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:57,065
There's a lot of tooling that

594
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,665
provides data exploration and

595
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,605
the ability to
navigate the graph.

596
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:04,585
However, typical end users are

597
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,800
too busy to go
through this sort

598
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,300
of paradigm. Make the user

599
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,460
interface clean and simple,

600
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,815
and provide
a selected slice of

601
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,395
the graph that'll be
meaningful to them.

602
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:19,795
Also in the user interface,

603
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:22,575
keep references
to the knowledge

604
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:26,070
graph to provide
additional value.

605
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,650
Thanks for your time,

606
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,350
and I hope you enjoyed
