00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,400
Welcome to this talk
on implementing

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,400
informed consent with
knowledge graphs.

4
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:13,415
My name is Anelioa Kurteva,

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,355
and I'm a PhD researcher at

6
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:18,215
the Semantic
Technology Institute

7
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:19,815
at the University
of Innsbruck.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,250
Currently, I am interested in

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,930
my PhD in knowledge graphs,

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,950
the semantic web
privacy, GDPR,

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,450
and human computer
interaction,

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,635
and how they can work together

13
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:35,175
to solve issues such
as, consent in,

14
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,800
different domains.
So let's begin.

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,020
A bit of
background information

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,340
on GDPR first. So GDPR became

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,825
applicable in May of twenty

18
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,685
eighteen in all member states

19
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:50,065
to harmonize data
privacy laws across,

20
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,385
Europe. GDPR's main aim is to

21
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,065
give control to
individuals over

22
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,170
their personal data,

23
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,810
and it introduced
the notion of

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,870
informed consent.

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,310
And, also, GDPR views consent

26
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:04,445
as one of its legal basis for

27
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:05,185
data processing.

28
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:06,605
But, of course,

29
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,365
there are hefty fines for not

30
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,825
being compliant with GDPR.

31
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,240
Up to ten million
or two percent,

32
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,520
of the firm's worldwide
annual revenue.

33
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,200
So what is consent
according to GDPR?

34
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:22,125
So consent according
to article

35
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,465
four of GDPR is
any freely given,

36
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:25,965
specific, informed,

37
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:29,560
and unambiguous
indication, of the data,

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,180
subject agreement
to the processing

39
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,320
of personal data
related to him or her.

40
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:37,325
And to be more specific,

41
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,645
what is exactly
informed consent?

42
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,705
So before the data subjects

43
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:43,625
grant consent, they
should be married,

44
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,170
aware of information
such as who

45
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,470
who is the data controller,

46
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,470
what kind of data
will be used,

47
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,790
for what purposes is
the data required,

48
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,545
how the data will be used,

49
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,245
how the data will
be processed,

50
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:56,905
where the data
will be stored,

51
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,445
with whom will be shared.

52
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,265
And, of course,

53
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,090
much more information that can

54
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,630
be provided here
to individuals

55
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,990
so they're more informed.

56
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,170
So here come two projects that

57
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,530
I'm currently working on and

58
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,365
that also consider,
GDPR and consent.

59
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,705
We have the company, project,

60
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,245
whose goal, is to,

61
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:19,165
develop an open platform on

62
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,440
which private and public

63
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
institutions can
create different

64
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,740
campaigns. And a campaigning

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,960
company is a specific request

66
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,540
for a data from
individuals, and,

67
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,925
that data will be analyzed.

68
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:33,225
The main focus for
now is vehicle

69
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:34,505
sensor data, and, actually,

70
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:37,405
company runs in
Hanover, Germany.

71
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,340
And the second project
is the Smashfit

72
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,840
project whose goal
is to establish

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,140
a framework, for secure and

74
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,055
trusted sharing of,

75
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:49,395
personal data and industrial

76
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,415
data streams across
different silos and,

77
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,020
smart cities, for example,

78
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,440
which I'll talk a bit a bit,

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,620
further in the presentation.

80
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,020
And, yes, consent
in smart cities.

81
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:06,115
So in a smart city,
consent is,

82
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:08,275
consent and also the data of

83
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,635
the individuals can be spread

84
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,335
across multiple
different zeroes,

85
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,640
which are databases,
locations,

86
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,140
people, and can be used for

87
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,660
different purposes
by different

88
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,640
entities simultaneously.

89
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,860
Here on the side,
you can see,

90
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,575
smart city domains.

91
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:24,155
We have smart retail,
smart mobility,

92
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:26,075
smart health,
smart government,

93
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,155
education, smart homes.

94
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,630
And, the other goal is to

95
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,850
implement the consent,

96
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,410
in a way that does
not distribute

97
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,725
the data flow between those

98
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,245
silos while still
being compliant

99
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,645
with GDPR. And
consent in smart

100
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:42,925
cities is actually one of,

101
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:44,600
the use cases that inspired

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
the smart chip project,

103
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,620
which you can also
have a look at.

104
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,560
So the main challenges that

105
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,215
we've identified are,
responsibilities.

106
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:57,835
Who is responsible for what?

107
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,660
Who records
the consent? Storage.

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,160
Where is the consent stored?

109
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,540
What privacy and security

110
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,980
mechanisms are in place?

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
Who has access to the consent

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,835
and also to the data?

113
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,595
And can the consent
decision of

114
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:11,615
the individual be
changed without the,

115
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,155
his knowledge? Also,

116
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:15,515
what are the implications of

117
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:16,575
revoking consent?

118
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,420
How can a user revoke
their consent?

119
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,580
And what happens
to the data and

120
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,940
the processes that,

121
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,660
use the consent
after the consent

122
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,400
is revoked?

123
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:28,605
And finally, awareness,

124
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,265
awareness of what it means to

125
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:31,885
give consent and
the implications

126
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:32,845
that follow.

127
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,830
Some knowledge graphs,

128
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,630
which I'm sure most
of you are aware of,

129
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,530
they can be used as
a consent solution,

130
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,450
and they have many
benefits that

131
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,595
can be related to
consent, but,

132
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:45,735
of course, are not limited.

133
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,555
For example, knowledge graph

134
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,315
provide transparency because

135
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:50,915
data is bought in
human readable

136
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,295
and machine readable formats.

137
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,670
They provide traceability,

138
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,430
which when it
comes to consent,

139
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,370
is really, crucial because,

140
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,110
it provides provenance,
information.

141
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:02,675
We can use different,

142
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:04,915
ontologies for
provenance events

143
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,475
and time stamp, data.

144
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,575
So we preserve
the records of consent,

145
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,650
when the consent
decision was made,

146
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,910
when it was changed,
and more.

147
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,810
We have also
knowledge discovery.

148
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,410
We can discover
different patterns

149
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,150
and consistencies,

150
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:20,385
security and privacy issues.

151
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,445
We can perform reasoning on

152
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,085
knowledge graphs,

153
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:24,525
which is especially useful for

154
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,065
GDPR compliance checking.

155
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,090
We can understand connections

156
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,590
between data. For example,

157
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,270
how a third party gain access

158
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,810
to specific user data.

159
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,830
And, of course,

160
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,270
knowledge graphs
provide a common

161
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,855
understanding
across all entities

162
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,175
in the smart cities
of the notion

163
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:42,155
of consent and
many more concepts

164
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,155
that exist in the domain.

165
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,600
So we performed a survey,

166
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
which you can check to have,

167
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,940
input to the reference
on semantic

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,140
models for consent.

169
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:55,175
And, of course,

170
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:56,775
work has been done
through the years,

171
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,095
and several
ontologies exist as

172
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,935
you can see. However,

173
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,715
we've identified
common limitations.

174
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,780
There these
ontologies are either

175
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,740
too general because,

176
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,940
they're part of project,

177
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,380
and these projects have their

178
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,400
own use cases. And
this the ontologies

179
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,785
also focus only on
these, use cases.

180
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:16,085
The ontologies, yes,

181
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,345
they represent only
consent sometimes,

182
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,370
which, means that no other

183
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,870
information about
the data itself,

184
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,930
or the processing
that's applied

185
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,310
to the data is modeled.

186
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:29,605
And, some of the ontologies,

187
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:33,025
do not model
consent state state

188
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,925
changes such as
revoked, withdrawn,

189
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,680
etcetera. And,

190
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,320
most of the ontologies are not

191
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,100
open access, which
can complicate

192
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,980
their reuse.

193
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,415
Current goals of,

194
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,355
the projects that
I presented,

195
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,935
Kompano and, SmashIt,

196
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,535
is to implement the life cycle

197
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:54,360
of informed consent
with knowledge

198
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,700
graphs. And when we
say life cycle,

199
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,060
we view,

200
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
here on the side the different

201
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,660
steps that can be undertaken

202
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,420
when dealing with consent.

203
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,225
We have the request
of consent,

204
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,685
the comprehension of consent,

205
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:08,205
the decision about consent,

206
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:09,705
and the use of consent.

207
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:13,150
And all of these,
stages also consists,

208
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,870
of, different sub
steps that can

209
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,630
be taken, different,

210
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,630
tools and approaches that can

211
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,355
be adopted when it comes to

212
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,775
the management of
consent at each stage.

213
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,075
And the next goal is to raise

214
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,355
the awareness about what it

215
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:30,615
means to give consent
and the implications

216
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:31,720
that follow.

217
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,340
So the first step that we took

218
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,620
is to model a sample,

219
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,720
a campaign in
the company or project.

220
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,160
The campaign is called,

221
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,485
and it's actually
a real campaign

222
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:42,925
that was run by the Tyrolian

223
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:44,465
government here in Austria,

224
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,625
a couple of years ago.

225
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,445
The main date of interest in

226
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:49,735
that campaign was to,

227
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,840
GPS data from car drivers in

228
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,360
the area of Innsbruck up to

229
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,820
fifteen kilometers away,

230
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,300
and the data was
stored anonymously

231
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,865
in a central database
in Kuchstein

232
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,945
or by owned by
the government.

233
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:06,605
Upon the user, consent,
the data was,

234
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,590
or will be also, up to today,

235
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,390
shared with, STI Innsbruck,

236
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,970
which is my research group,

237
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,070
and we run different
processing connect.

238
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,835
So based on that
simple campaign,

239
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:26,375
we created our, main
ontology and then,

240
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:29,680
we added data and
created the the

241
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,620
knowledge graph, which
you can see here.

242
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,300
It's quite simple
and represents

243
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,740
currently only one campaign.

244
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,535
Rosa Finn's book has
presented earlier,

245
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:39,135
and we have the different data

246
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,055
associated with it
when the consent

247
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,375
was asked. So we
have the status

248
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,395
of consent, which is, given.

249
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,330
We have the duration
of campaign,

250
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,230
twelve days. We have
the main purpose,

251
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,610
which is for fraud detection.

252
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,605
We have also who
requested the campaign,

253
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:56,465
which is the Innsbruck
government.

254
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,145
We have the type of
data, GPS data,

255
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,005
and, of course,

256
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:04,100
the person who gave
their consent.

257
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
And while this
data is really,

258
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,020
easy to understand by machines

259
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,905
and experts both in
human readable,

260
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:15,205
machine readable format.

261
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,505
How can individuals with no

262
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:19,365
knowledge of linked
data understand

263
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,485
this, model?

264
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,310
So we decided to
visualize the consent

265
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,510
first, and,

266
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,370
we began by analyzing existing

267
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,990
consent request
user interfaces.

268
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,865
Some of the issues that,

269
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:35,325
we came across are
information overload,

270
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:37,800
privacy and policy privacy

271
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,240
policies written in technical

272
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,540
and legal jargon.

273
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,280
As you can see
here on the side,

274
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,800
we have long documents and

275
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,265
legalese that people rarely

276
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:48,885
understand and read.

277
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:50,625
We have consent requests which

278
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,145
are which are not
really compliant

279
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:55,030
with GDPR because no
information about,

280
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,950
the consent is presented.

281
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,670
For example, why is
the data required?

282
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,790
Why is the data,

283
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,365
what is the purpose
of the data,

284
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:06,645
how data will be processed,

285
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:09,205
where where the data
will be stored,

286
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:11,050
and more. And, also,

287
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,190
these user interfaces,

288
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,370
do not clearly indicate that

289
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,545
the individuals
have the right to,

290
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,385
revoke their consent,

291
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,445
which is also
known as the right

292
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:23,265
to be forgotten.

293
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:25,985
So we, created,

294
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,590
a simple user interface for

295
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,790
the company or project,

296
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,790
which displays
the different campaigns,

297
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,250
which you can see
on the side.

298
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,190
Or it you can see
campaigns from

299
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,250
different companies.

300
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,365
The UI was developed with,

301
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,345
Google's new UI toolkit
called Flutter,

302
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,005
and it follows the,

303
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,325
consent knowledge
graph which we,

304
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,950
shown before.

305
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,570
And the UI is designed to be

306
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,750
used in vehicles,
for example,

307
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,990
on tablet or a phone
by the individual.

308
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,575
Here, you can see more details

309
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:00,075
about the actual
campaign the details

310
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:02,475
when the user
selects the campaign

311
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:04,075
by by, Volkswagen.

312
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,310
You can see the,
company name,

313
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,150
the campaign, roads
of Innsbruck,

314
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,670
what data will be collected,

315
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,850
when is the start date,

316
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,230
the end date of the campaign.

317
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:16,415
And further, when
the user selects

318
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,495
to agree to
participate in that

319
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,515
campaign, we
present them with,

320
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:23,520
preference, lists.

321
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
So the user can select really

322
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
if they want to share all of

323
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,380
their data that's asked
for or only GPS,

324
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,640
tire pressure, speed,

325
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,220
and then finalize
their consent.

326
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,625
But then, we were,

327
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:40,085
thinking of how
to even further,

328
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,990
help raise the awareness
of individuals.

329
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,930
So we decided to focus on

330
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,890
visualizing of,

331
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,510
what happens after
the consent is given.

332
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,045
And for that, we use, again,

333
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,085
the knowledge graph which we

334
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,525
have with
the different campaigns

335
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,065
as the main source
of information

336
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:00,585
and the d three,
visualization library.

337
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
And, we actually
published a paper

338
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,060
in June this year.

339
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,060
You can, have a look if you're

340
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,800
more interested,

341
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,200
which focuses exactly
on this topic.

342
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,675
So we presented
individuals, with,

343
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:13,615
this, user interface.

344
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,795
In the middle,
you can see this

345
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:18,075
is the vehicle from which,

346
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:21,120
the data is transmitted
or the individual

347
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,700
itself inside of the vehicle,

348
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,740
and we have the different

349
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,520
campaigns that
these individuals

350
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,460
participates in.

351
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,720
For example, green
future, drive smart,

352
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:31,065
highway zero,
and each campaign

353
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:33,165
is associated
with, different,

354
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:34,845
types of data.

355
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,985
And we use color blocking to

356
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:38,690
identify that. For example,

357
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,150
speed is in yellow,
GPS is in purple,

358
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,210
and we have also a team change

359
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,510
from light to dark.

360
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,135
You can actually test the user

361
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,295
interface, here and play with

362
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,615
it for yourself,
see if you like it,

363
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:52,895
and maybe you can even,

364
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:55,030
provide some feedback about,

365
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,710
future improvements
that can be

366
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,050
done to it. So when
the individual

367
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,970
selects a campaign,
for example,

368
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,365
green future,
they're presented

369
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,885
with a bit more detailed,

370
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:06,885
information about
this campaign.

371
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:10,770
Specifically, what
type of data was,

372
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,110
retrieved at what time and by

373
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,170
which company.

374
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,065
We performed some
user evaluation.

375
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,305
We had twenty five
participants,

376
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,310
female and, male,
age eighteen to,

377
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,790
fifty five, with different

378
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,930
university degrees,

379
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,235
and eighty percent of them had

380
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,695
a driving license.

381
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,455
Evaluation details
you can find

382
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,295
in the paper.

383
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,380
So, we asked
the same questions

384
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,340
about consent
before presenting

385
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,160
the individuals with
the UI and after.

386
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,155
So, before,

387
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:51,215
we asked them if
they're willing

388
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,135
to share their
GPS location and

389
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,635
other types of data
with companies,

390
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,840
and most of them
said that probably,

391
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,600
not and never they would share

392
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,980
such data. And
after we presented

393
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,420
them with a visualization of

394
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,745
what happens to their,

395
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:08,765
data after consent is given,

396
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:10,665
most of them actually changed

397
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,445
their opinion and
said that possibly,

398
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,710
they would if they
had this, tool.

399
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,210
Next, we asked them to,

400
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,305
describe the interface
with some

401
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,005
keywords. They said
it's organized,

402
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:25,445
effective, innovative.

403
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:29,445
We also evaluated
the comprehension

404
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:30,245
of individuals.

405
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,010
We asked them if
they can easily

406
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,370
see what's happening to their

407
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,750
data at specific times,

408
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,430
and most of the individuals

409
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,590
strongly agreed and agreed.

410
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,545
And, when asked if the graph

411
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:44,305
helped them understand what

412
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,805
happens to their data,
most individuals,

413
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,150
again, agreed and
strongly agreed.

414
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,690
So the main takeaways from our

415
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,630
evaluation are
that visualizations

416
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,085
help increase
the comprehension

417
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,885
of what it means to
give consent and,

418
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,605
trust of the users.

419
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,285
And that,

420
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,680
the application
that we created

421
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,200
creates more transparency,

422
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,200
the data sharing process.

423
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,995
Here are just some
examples of,

424
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:18,255
future things that,

425
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,590
I think are also important to

426
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,790
want to consider.

427
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,770
For example, consent standard

428
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,765
standardization. I think that

429
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:30,005
the W3C consent
community group

430
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:32,085
is currently working
towards different,

431
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,045
and better solutions
for consent

432
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,140
so you can have a look there.

433
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,200
Also, what happens,

434
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,620
beyond GDPR because
GDPR, yes,

435
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,795
it's a a really
huge law, but,

436
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:48,695
in some places, it
does not apply.

437
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,355
In California, for example,

438
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:51,415
we have the CCPA,

439
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:53,090
and other countries have their

440
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,470
own laws about consent.

441
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,890
And when in some cases,

442
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,570
consent might not be enough,

443
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,485
and what happens then?

444
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,065
Maybe contracts
and licenses can

445
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:05,425
come into play.

446
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:06,765
So these are just some things

447
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,685
that we can all think about.

448
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,840
And if you have
any suggestions

449
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,020
