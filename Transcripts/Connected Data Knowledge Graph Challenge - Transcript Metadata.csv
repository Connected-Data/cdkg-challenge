Neural Algorithmic Reasoning: Combining Classical Algorithms and Neural Networks,Andreea Deac,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Andreea Deac - Neural Algorithmic Reasoning_ Combining Classical Algorithms and Neural Networks.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Graph AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReEqDt_57Jg,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/neural-algorithmic-reasoning-combining-classical-algorithms-and-neural-networks/,"Nowadays, using known algorithms to solve a problem or leverging advances in deep learning to tackle it are seen as two orthogonal manners to reach a solution. However, many problems could benefit instead from a combination of the two.

Here, I will present the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) direction and how it aims to combine the guarantees and generalization power of the classical algorithms with the adaptability and possibility of working directly with raw data of neural networks. Moreover, I will introduce NAR's successful application to the field of reinforcement learning.

More precisely, I will summarise how a neural network can imitate a dynamic programming planning algorithm, that can guarantee finding optimal solutions, resulting in performance gains especially in low-data environments.

If you’re looking at solving a real-world problem and you think there are heuristics that could be helpful, but not fully solving it and/or that require the data to be thoroughly denoised before being useful, I would say this talk is for you!"
Applying Semantic Web Standards for Knowledge Representation at Elsevier,Veronique Moore,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Applying Semantic Web Standards for Knowledge Representation at Elsevier _ Veronique Moore.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Semantic Technology, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK0s2BMA73o,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/applying-semantic-web-standards-for-knowledge-representation-at-elsevier-quality-assurance-and-release-processes/,"In our talk we will touch on our mission at Elsevier is to deliver data to improve our customer’s efficiency, may they be researchers, students, geo professionals or medical professionals.

To achieve this goal, we are working simultaneously on keeping our data up to date, accurate and on streamlining the delivery of the knowledge representation structures (KRS) backing our tools and products such as ScienceDirect, - Topic Pages, Engineering Village and more.

We align our quality assurance (QA) and delivery methods with Semantic Web standards, relying on SHACL, SPARQL for QA, RDF standard serializations for releases. We also align with international vocabulary standards, to deliver standard identifiers to our customers to support interoperability.

To make our data searchable, we also aim at dereferencing 100% of our entities on an internal platform based on a triple store and have achieved this goal for over 20 KRSs serving 5 different products.

We also work on mappings and cross-references across the KRSs to increase the efficiency of data management, and boost product interoperability."
Data Observability: How to Eliminate Data Downtime and Start Trusting Your Data,Barr Moses,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Data Observability_ How to Eliminate Data Downtime and Start Trusting Your Data _ Barr Moses.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Semantic Technology, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1_RaYDeXFs,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/data-observability-how-to-eliminate-data-downtime-and-start-trusting-your-data/,"Broken data is costly, time-consuming, and nowadays, an all-too-common reality for even the most advanced data teams.

In this talk, I’ll introduce this problem, called “data downtime” — periods of time when data is partial, erroneous, missing or otherwise inaccurate — and discuss how to eliminate it in your data ecosystem with end-to-end data observability.

Drawing corollaries to application observability in software engineering, data observability is a critical component of the modern DataOps workflow and the key to ensuring data trust at scale.

I’ll share a quick start approach to achieving data observability at scale and highlight the important role of graph analytics and metadata in driving this process."
One graph to bind them all! Linking data & apps for event-driven interoperability,Dave Duggal,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Dave Duggal - One graph to bind them all!

Reifying data over applications, or vice-versa, simply reinforces silos and obscures holistic solutions. It’s time for a unified approach!

The solution to increasingly fragmented business operations is a digital business platform that brings together data products and business capabilities. A unified interface provides a consistent experience, shared metadata & domain semantics, and common tools across teams so everyone can benefit, contribute and collaborate. After all, the digital business is about IT productivity, service velocity and business agility.

This session will demonstrate how EnterpriseWeb’s platform provides an umbrella, graph-connected abstraction over diverse service elements, distributed endpoints and federated components to enable discovery, interoperability & automation.

The presentation will feature a short use-case demo. It will show how a no-code platform can leverage a graph language to rapidly model complex domains, onboard objects to a catalog, compose objects into services and chain services in to event-driven, end-to-end processes across business silos, ecosystem partners and cloud-services."
Knowledge Mesh: From Data Silos to Data Fabric at Global 2000 Enterprises, David Amzallag and Szymon Klarman,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/David Amzallag & Szymon Klarman - Knowledge Mesh_ From Data Silos to Data Fabric at Global 2000 EPs.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Knowledge Graphs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyuBXiWcASQ,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/knowledge-mesh-from-data-silos-to-data-fabric-at-global-2000-enterprises/,"A common go-to data strategy adopted in large, data-intensive enterprises, is based on creation of centralized, monolithic data platforms, such as data warehouses or data lakes. Such platforms are well-known for their many limitations and lack of long-term sustainability: growing stale data silos, loss of ownership and domain context of data assets, and organizational bottlenecks around highly specialized data engineering teams. The ultimate outcome is the increase of the cost of effective data utilization within the enterprise.

Data fabric is a design concept combining multiple modern data management technologies aimed towards supporting “frictionless access and sharing of data in a distributed network environment” (Gartner).

Knowledge Mesh, a recent product delivered by BlackSwan Technologies, is an implementation of the data fabric architecture, consisting of domain-driven metadata and (meta)data management and integration tools aimed to maximize the effectiveness of data utilization in knowledge graph applications in different domains.

In this presentation we will:

- Introduce BlackSwan Technologies with its core technology vision and offering
- Describe the challenges involved in 360-degree entity view use-cases at Global 2000 enterprises
- Explain how enterprise knowledge graphs (EKG) help addressing these challenges
- Introduce the concept of data fabric via its implementation as Knowledge Mesh, and argue for its capabilities of scaling and automating EKG development in multiple domains"

What are the necessary properties of representational structures that could allow vast amounts of data become meaningful in the human sense of the word? How can knowledge architectures be constructed in a way that allows for both the efficiency and effectiveness of models they support?

In this keynote, Gadi Singer will discuss anthropomorphic conceptual structures and their benefits for enhancing Cognitive AI capabilities, as well as his model of the three levels of knowledge – Thrill-K – which can serve as a blueprint for building AI systems that are both efficient and scalable."
Graph Thinking,Paco Nathan,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Graph Thinking _ Paco Nathan _ Connected Data World 2021.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Knowledge Graphs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTehzXynnLM,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/graph-thinking/,"This talk explores Graph Thinking as a means for conceptualizing problems which can be solved using graph technologies.

Parallels can be found in learning theory, for example how people organize knowledge into graph-like cognitive structures as they progress from novice to practitioner to expert levels in a given field.

This talk introduces a set of intuitive examples which convey the power of graph technologies – plus their trade-offs – to domain experts, to be used as a starting point for new graph projects. 
This approach has been refined through business use cases in industrial AI for firms in EU, and attempts to overcome some of the cognitive hurdles that organizations face during large graph initiatives.

To put this into context, we'll review a set of common use cases in industry and how graph data science practices can be built using Python open source, along with a survey of available libraries to leverage for different aspects of graph technologies.

Then we'll show the 'kglab' abstraction layer whichintegrates these various libraries into the PyData stack"
How a Knowledge Graph Can Support Advanced Price Analytics in Supply Chain Management,Marcus Nölke,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/How a Knowledge Graph Can Support Advanced Price Analytics in Supply Chain Management _ Marcus Nölke.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Knowledge Graphs, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BayxNXUS6uA,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/how-a-knowledge-graph-can-support-advanced-price-analytics-in-supply-chain-management/,"In a company with high purchasing volume, it is crucial to design cost-efficient parts and procure these parts at competitive pricing level.

Data analytics can support on both aspects. Unfortunately, supply chain transactional data but also product life cycle data can be messy and distributed among many applications and data silos.

For the task to determine if a particular offer or paid price for a part is reasonable, the following two problems need to be solved:

Definition of scope: What do I get for the price? Are there any options included? Is packaging and transportation part of the offer?

Definition of requirements/features: What is the underlying product specification of this offer? What is the material? What special requirements does it fulfill?

Therefore, pricing information needs to be connected to design information and a clear designation system for scope and requirements must be developed in a way that it can be formally represented by a machine.

This presentation will provide insight on how a Knowledge Graph is used to deal with heterogenous data input. Additionally, an example will show how automated pricing analytics is possible using semantics and logic available in the Knowledge Graph.

A Knowledge Graph can serve here as a data integration layer based on a shared vocabulary, defined relations and properties for parts and components of which the company’s products are made of.

A crucial role plays the use of core ontologies applicable for industrial and financial domain such as the ISO 15926-14 or the FIBO ontologies. QUDT is helpful in providing a solid basis for units and measurements.

Additional domain ontologies e.g. for purchasing or engineering help to include semantics and relations among the specific domain data elements.

The transactional purchasing data as well as product design data will be mapped to the concepts and relations defined in the core and domain ontologies.

With the help of a reasoning engine automatic identification, classification and relation mapping is done. This results in automated pricing evaluations possible for most parts of the purchasing volume.

For instance, the inlet system for a gas turbine is modeled with properties such as material or inlet mass flow. Past and current pricing of the inlet system is available from the global purchasing organization for the entire gas turbine portfolio ranging from small engines to very large engines.

Using the above inlet system data model with the defined properties a regression chart can be established showing inlet system pricing over mass flow and material categories. Both properties are known to be the major cost drivers for such systems.

The regression chart can be used to determine an average price level or for detecting price anomalies. E.g. an specific offer can be evaluated against the average or even lowest price line.

This procedure is also called (multi) linear performance pricing (see https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linear_Performance_Pricing.png) where sales prices are shown related to performance. Performance is an aggregated value considering the important part properties.

Using a Knowledge Graph with reasoning capabilities it is possible to apply linear performance pricing at scale for all parts which need to be purchased within a company. The relevant data can be automatically mapped from legacy data bases into the Knowledge Graph. No manual data collection, curation and update processes are necessary."

Hybridization of Machine Learning and Operational Research is the future of AI ,Nikolaj van Omme,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Hybridization of Machine Learning and Operational Research is the future of AI _ Nikolaj van Omme.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Graph AI, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTHv0JQS7_g,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/hybridization-of-machine-learning-and-operational-research-is-the-future-of-ai/,"Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) gained a lot of attention, but did you know that Graph theory is actually considered by some as a subfield of Operations Research?

Even better, did you know that Machine Learning (ML) was considered as a subfield of Operations Research (OR) a few years ago without (much) controversy?

What is OR you might ask? Not an easy question but think about optimization. Every time you try to optimize something, you probably are in the realm of OR somehow.

ML as a subfield of OR? Basically, in ML you try to ... optimize your predictions!  Beyond naming disputes, there are two fields, ML and OR, that are remarkably complementary and when you combine them together you can go (much) further than just using ML or just using OR.

There are at least 4 ways to combine ML and OR. You can use ML and OR as two black boxes without any interaction between the two.

Most of the time, you use ML to get accurate predictions in a first step and then in a second step, you optimize your problem with OR using those predictions as an input.

Then there are two technical ways to use them: use one to improve the other. It works in both directions and it really improves algorithms in both fields. Finally, there is a fourth way to combine both where new algorithms are created.

The first combination is becoming more and more popular and used since about 2019 to solve industrial problems.

The second and third combinations are essentially the subject of academic research by a few teams around the world.

The fourth combination is quite unknown but is probably the most interesting one as - in my view - it could lead to real intelligence.

In this talk, I'll briefly present what OR is and how it is related to ML. Then I'll present real and successful industrial cases for the first three combinations. I will conclude by briefly presenting what I believe can be done with the fourth combination."

Data sharing has been a popular research topic for many years, however, a unified solution for the transparent implementation of consent, in compliance with GDPR that could be used as a standard, has not been presented yet.

In this talk I will present my research, which proposes a solution for implementing informed consent for sensor data sharing in compliance with GDPR with semantic technology, namely knowledge graphs.

The main objectives are to model the life cycle of informed consent (i.e. the request, comprehension, decision and use of consent) with knowledge graphs so that it is easily interpretable by machines, and to graphically visualise it to individuals in order to raise legal awareness of what it means to consent and the implications that follow.

The talk is suitable for both academia researchers and industry professionals."

A research project funded by the National Security Agency, D3FEND provides a large collection of digital artifacts to model cyber systems and related countermeasures.

This creates a foundation for automated reasoning about the complex interplay between computer network architectures, threats, and cyber countermeasures. Our is goal to make it easier for architects to understand how countermeasures work, so that they can more effectively design, deploy, and ultimately better defend networked systems.

D3FEND is a framework which provides a countermeasure knowledge base, but more specifically, a knowledge graph. The graph contains semantically rigorous types and relations that define both the key concepts in the cybersecurity countermeasure domain and the relations necessary to link those concepts to each other.

We ground each of the concepts and relations to particular references in the cybersecurity literature. Numerous sources of research and development literature were analyzed, including a targeted sample of over 500 countermeasure patents drawn from the U.S. Patent Office corpus. The graph supports queries that can inferentially map architectural elements to both cybersecurity countermeasures and offensive TTPs."

More recently, Graph Machine Learning applied directly on graphs using graph algorithms and machine learning, has been demonstrating significant advantages in solving the same problems as graph analytics as well as problems that are impractical to solve using graph analytics.  Graph Machine Learning does this by training statistical models on the graph  resulting in Graph Embeddings and Graph Neural Networks that are used to complex problems in a different way.

In this talk, we will compare and contrast these two approaches (spoiler: often complexity vs precision) in real-world scenarios. What factors should you consider when choosing one over the other and when do you even have a choice?

Several technologies have arisen in the last few years, including JSON, machine learning systems, GraphQL, Lambdas, and others.

What's more, the first generation semantic web has struggled to assert itself while dealing with problems such as the failure of adoption of complex ontologies, data science workflows that have largely bypassed RDF as a mechanism for expressing rich data structures, slow adoption of even foundational technologies such as Property Graphs, RDF-Star, SHACL, or JSON-LD.

The focus of this talk is to explore the emergence of second-generation knowledge graphs, utilizing GraphQL as a means to abstract out data models and construct both set and hierarchical structures in a manner that makes sense to the data science, machine-learning, and web communities.

Additionally, such tools make mutational processing independent of platform, and even, utilizing such abstractions, make it possible to create truly functional and dynamic properties in the space.

This author hopes to explore how GraphQL and related paradigms (DIDs, machine learning models, web component frameworks, distributed ledgers and hyperstatial systems) all will impact the future of the knowledge graph over the course of the next decade and beyond."
Legal Knowledge Graphs,Vaishali Raghvani,/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/Legal Knowledge Graphs _ Vaishali Raghvani _ Connected Data World.srt,Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Knowledge Graphs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN0HGTxXXKI,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/legal-knowledge-graphs/,"Creating and negotiating legal documents and contracts usually requires legal expertise which can be prohibitively expensive for small businesses and unlawyered individuals.

Accessing what’s in a contract and knowing which contracts have been signed is complicated because of the traditional text/pdf structure of documents.

Legislate is helping bring structure to documents thanks to knowledge graph technology. Legislate is also improving the visual representation of contracts with knowledge graphs to allow non-lawyers to better understand their rights and obligations as well as other implicit information which can be derived from contract data using reasoning.

Legislate is used by small businesses, landlords, letting agents and individuals who can’t justify the cost of using a lawyer to create and negotiate contracts. Small businesses use Legislate to create and manage employment documents and non-disclosure agreements. Property businesses use Legislate to create and manage tenancy related documents.

Legislate uses knowledge graphs to model contracts and legal expertise as rules to empower non-lawyers to create lawyer-approved contracts by themselves. Using a knowledge graph to model contracts unlocks additional benefits for managing documents at any point in their lifecycle.

By knowing exactly what terms are in a contract and where they are, Legislate contracts are highly searchable, know how they connect with each other and can aggregate statistics which would otherwise need to be manually extracted and calculated in a legacy spreadsheet.

Legislate’s knowledge graph contract metrics give deeper insight into a portfolio of a landlord or a small business owner.

For example a property owner can see how much rent they are earning each year from all their properties as well as the distribution for their properties and corresponding rental prices. Employers can better understand their real time payroll across employees, interns and consultants."

They seem simple, flexible, and familiar. They are widely used. And they seem to work across many use cases and many domains.

But when looked at in more detail, taxonomies turn out to be crude tools for knowledge organization that are very difficult to create, to scale, to adapt, to align, and to build on.

They don't work well for larger or more complex domains and use cases. Experienced talent and flexible tools for creating them are hard to find and to develop. Often taxonomies are built then abandoned for other, more robust approaches to knowledge organization.

It is essential to re-evaluate your connected data strategies in the context of alternative approaches to knowledge organization."

To enable ""mass adoption"" of graph technology, we need to establish the right abstractions, access APIs, and data models.

RDF triples, while of paramount importance in establishing RDF graph semantics, are a low-level abstraction, much like using assembly language. For practical and productive “graph programming” we need something different.

Similarly, existing declarative graph query languages (such as SPARQL and Cypher) are not always the best way to access graph data, and sometimes you need a simpler interface (e.g., GraphQL), or even a different approach altogether (e.g., imperative traversals such as with Gremlin).

Furthermore, the nascent graph database industry has not been able to settle on a single graph model: Developers are forced to choose between RDF, a standard that offers broad interoperability, and Labeled Property Graphs (LPG), which offer an object model-like abstraction but lack interoperability.

We present ongoing work towards “OneGraph” (1G), a unifying logical model for graphs. 1G will enable developers to choose their higher-level graph abstractions and query language(s) independent of a particular graph model (RDF or LPG), and thus they do not have to worry that this choice will later limit their access to other available tooling (ETL, visualization, etc.)."

At the highest level, questions often take the form: ‘what is the best _?’. Today we ask a question appropriate for its unmatched speed, finding like for like as the fastest out there. Who is the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time?

Affected by so many variables, how can you compare Hamilton to Schumacher to Lauda when they raced decades apart? With half a century of race data, RDFox gives the answer.

Designed around a highly optimised in-memory approach, it affords query and loading times that are orders of magnitudes faster than alternative triplestores. RDFox is developed by Oxford Semantic Technologies—an Oxford University spin-out founded by leading academics and backed by decades of cutting-edge research in semantic web technologies, recognised with a Lovelace Medal."
"RDF Leveled the Advantages of LPG and Keeps 3 Key Benefits: Standards, Semantics & Interoperability",Atanas Kiryakov,"/Transcripts/Connected Data World 2021/Presentations/RDF Leveled the Advantages of LPG and Keeps 3 Key Benefits_ Standards, Semantics & Interoperability.srt",Connected Data World 2021,03/12/2021,Presentation,Semantic Technology,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwgj6nF53Tg,,https://2021.connecteddataworld.com/talks/rdf-leveled-the-advantages-of-lpg-and-keeps-3-key-benefits-standards-semantics-and-interoperability/,"Knowledge graphs are the next generation tool for helping businesses make critical decisions, based on harmonized knowledge models and data derived from siloed source systems. Due to the huge value generated by their data standardization and semantic modeling capabilities, knowledge graphs are most often associated with data integration, linking, unification and information reuse. As more and more organizations are turning to knowledge graphs for better data and content analytics, search and graph exploration become key requirements also.

For many years, two main advantages of labeled property graphs (LPG) have been pointed out: they can deal with properties on edges in the graph and they are good for graph traversal. They are gone now, given that the leading triplestores support:

- RDF-star, which offers a simple and efficient mechanism to attach metadata to the edges of a graph, e.g. weights, access restrictions and provenance information.
- SPARQL extensions that allow for exploration of multi-hop relationships in graphs.
The support for these extensions of the RDF and SPARQL is not implemented as a patch allowing us to check the box. RDF-star is already used by tools downstream and evaluations that prove efficiency improvement in managing Wikidata. RDF-star goes beyond the expressivity of LPG offering not just key-value pairs, but rather the full flexibility of making statements about statements.

Ever since version 1.1 SPARQL property paths support graph traversal, allowing you to discover relationships between resources through arbitrary length patterns. Property paths uncover the start and end nodes of a specific path, but not the intermediate ones. There are standard complaint extensions of SPARQL now, which offer exploration of the paths and support all the different variants of the task, e.g. shortest path vs. all paths. And there are RDF engines that take advantage of their reasoning capabilities to score well at the LDBC Social Network Benchmark.

Having graph-exploration covered, let us go back to the core requirements for knowledge graph management. RDF is recognized as the better option for knowledge graphs, because its web-native syntax supports data exchange and sharing and because its formal semantics allows for easy alignment of meaning and structure across sources, unified views and unambiguous interpretation.

On the other hand, LPGs lack many features that are an absolute must for enterprise data management, e.g. schema language, data serialization formats and federation. On the semantics side, they lack ontology modelling language and data validation. What’s most important, there are no standards in the LPG space to guarantee interoperability and reduce vendor lock in.

RDF engines check all the boxes: simple-yet-powerful graph model, standard schema and query languages, formal semantics, efficient graph traversal, analytics and reasoning, packed with all the enterprise features. There are a couple of cases where LPGs still have an edge: micromanaged exploration using Gremlin and heavy analytics for wardrobes with TBs of RAM."

Content that is extracted from these original sources must be precise and understood in context – but have often been transformed, modified and renamed to drive the software that propels our applications.

The result is the use of common words that mean different things and the expression of common concepts using a variety of words. The problem is exacerbated when seeking to align systems and processes because the terms used in one application do not always capture critical nuances that are needed for onward processing.

We refer to this problem as “data incongruence” and it is a serious liability. It was created by technology fragmentation and proprietary approaches to data integration. It adds cost, complexity and structural rigidity to operations. It diverts resources away from business goals and leads to frustration by stakeholders. It extends the time-to-value for new initiatives and often leads to more regulatory oversight challenges.

This is a problem that can be solved. The payoff is significant, and the value is sustainable. There is a real cost associated with the transformation, but the cost is relatively short-term (and the transition can be managed incrementally). And while it is not a ‘rip and replace’ technology cost – it does require a mindset shift and does include a series of data integration challenges."

The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure.

The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning.

The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure.

In this talk, we present our recent GraphEDM unified framework which bridges the gap between these disparate bodies.

One compelling approach is to merge private data with the plethora of available public sources into a seemingly single unit that is searchable and regularly updated.

In this talk we demonstrate how we achieved this vision using a scalable asynchronous stream processing architecture that can handle Terabytes of data and ensure data relevance via regular updates.

Eran Avidan offers an overview of a novel architecture based on Kafka streams, Kubernetes and Neo4J that easily enables the transformation of any piece of information into a knowledge graph structure while maintaining its freshness over time.

The solution is based on a series of distributed asynchronous steps that ‘listens’ to changes in private and public data sources including sales information, marketing activity, social media and commercial websites, extracts knowledge, structures the knowledge into a multitude of appropriate graph formations, and inserts that knowledge into a large and growing graph database.

This solution serves as a knowledge base for new AI models that are used by Intel’s Sales and Marketing Group to aid in detecting otherwise difficult to find links between potential clients and as a result directly help Intel in better serving its customers.

The Sales AI knowledge graph currently holds hundreds of millions of connected entities with thousands being fetched, enriched and connected to the graph by the hour.

The approach is highly generalizable and can be applied to a broad range of settings that could benefit from integration of large private and public data into a rich graph of knowledge."
