1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,900
So hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,540
Good to see you virtually.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,340
I hope everyone
is staying safe,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
and, we'll see how this goes.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,800
I've never actually
given a talk

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,025
on what I think
the frontier is.

7
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:20,885
So I I'll speak
for about fifteen

8
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,005
minutes, twenty minutes,

9
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:23,925
hopefully no more than that,

10
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,625
and then open up
to questions.

11
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:29,385
Let me make sure
I time myself.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,150
And today's talk
is going to be

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,190
very high level.

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,290
It's not a technical
talk, although,

15
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,450
you know, if you
want resources,

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,450
I'm happy to point
you to that.

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,190
But today is
really a very high

18
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,530
level talk. Everyone
is welcome to,

19
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,055
hopefully, it's
accessible to everyone.

20
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,435
Alright. So a little
bit about me.

21
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,995
So I am a a professor at USC,

22
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,695
the University of
Southern California.

23
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,575
But I think beyond USC,

24
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,055
what I like to say
is my projects

25
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,170
define me. So I'm
very proud of

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,150
all my projects,

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,290
everyone who works
on my projects,

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,830
everyone I collaborate with,

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,250
all my students, all my,

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,490
partners in all of
these projects,

31
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,510
they're all multi
partner projects.

32
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:16,065
And here are just
six of them.

33
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:18,945
Almost all involve
knowledge graphs,

34
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:20,945
some a little bit, unusually,

35
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,565
and not in a very
traditional way.

36
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,025
Others are much
more traditional.

37
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:28,360
So, there's ecommerce where we

38
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,180
work a lot with, with
industry partners.

39
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,800
I'll say a little
bit about that,

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,420
but, not too much.

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,840
There are, AI for social good

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,600
projects that I'm
very involved in.

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,435
Human trafficking
is a big one,

44
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,535
but also crisis response.

45
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,315
AI networks and society is one

46
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:51,395
where knowledge
graphs are less

47
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:52,435
traditionally used.

48
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,115
It starts intersecting with

49
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,395
network signs, actually,

50
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,350
and that's that's
a very interesting

51
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,610
way to, think about
knowledge graphs.

52
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,430
And then, some of
the others are

53
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,950
more moonshot projects that I

54
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,630
think are really,
sort of, relevant to,

55
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,250
to the frontier.

56
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,910
So the common sense reasoning

57
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,835
is one project
where we're trying

58
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:14,155
to get AI to actually
have common sense,

59
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,615
which is a very hard problem,

60
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,655
and is very related
to the frontier

61
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,515
that, that we hope knowledge

62
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,215
graphs can conquer
eventually.

63
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,710
So let's get started with just

64
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,990
what is a knowledge graph.

65
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,830
Now, you know, this may seem

66
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,950
redundant because,

67
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,630
you're in a conference that is

68
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,330
named after knowledge graphs,

69
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,470
and I I believe we are now in

70
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,850
the third day of
the conference.

71
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,095
So, you know, you
must have seen

72
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,795
a lot on knowledge graphs.

73
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,115
But I I like to give
two definitions,

74
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,535
you know, just so we are on

75
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:46,435
the same page.

76
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:49,935
Now one definition is the more

77
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,075
intuitive one,

78
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,715
which is that
a knowledge graph is,

79
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,600
a set of entities, relations,

80
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,980
and attributes, you know,

81
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
that are linked together in in

82
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,180
the way that you see over here

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,545
represented as
a graph, You know,

84
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:08,905
but but the key thing is what

85
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:09,625
is in the graph.

86
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,085
So it's entities, relations,

87
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:11,885
and attributes.

88
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,045
Entities like Bob
Dylan and Steve Jobs,

89
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,725
relations like, lives
in, was born in,

90
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:21,005
and attributes like,
Robert, the man,

91
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:22,680
you know, the the,

92
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,620
what we would
call the semantic

93
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,400
web community as literals.

94
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,060
So, you know, it
can contain a lot

95
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,780
more than that,

96
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
but but these are
usually the the

97
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,460
things that most
knowledge graphs

98
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,645
contain. Now there is a second

99
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,825
definition that is
much more technical,

100
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,885
and it's one that you may not

101
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:42,925
have heard before.

102
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,945
So I want to make sure
I give it to you,

103
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,505
which is that
a knowledge graph is,

104
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:52,640
a directed labeled
multiracial graph,

105
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,220
with semantics. So
I'll repeat that.

106
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,140
A knowledge graph
is a directed

107
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,200
you can see their
directions labeled.

108
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,940
There are labels
on pretty much

109
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,825
everything,
multiracial because

110
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:12,605
there are the edge
labels are usually,

111
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:14,345
there's more than one.

112
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:15,705
In fact, there's usually more

113
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,165
than five or ten even.

114
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:19,170
So in that sense,

115
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,610
it's very different
from a social

116
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,890
network where you
just have one

117
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,070
or two relations,
like friends or,

118
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,810
you know, LinkedIn connection

119
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,690
or whatever it is.

120
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,970
But there's only one or two

121
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,990
relations in most
social networks.

122
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,730
In a knowledge graph,
you have many,

123
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,110
many relations usually.

124
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:34,975
And it's what semantics.

125
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,655
The labels can't
be arbitrary.

126
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,955
They're not, things that don't

127
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,055
make sense, but
there is something

128
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:42,475
in the knowledge graph,

129
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:43,675
and that's the knowledge in

130
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,915
the knowledge graph that makes

131
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:49,610
it amenable to, some
model of semantics.

132
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,350
And I'll say
a little bit about

133
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,630
what we mean by semantics.

134
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,410
It's a complicated issue,

135
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,170
the the notion of semantics.

136
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,850
So that's the definition.

137
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,810
Two definitions.

138
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,690
One, intuitive, one,
more technical.

139
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:04,605
I prefer the intuitive one,

140
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,205
but you're free to go
with the technical

141
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,265
one as well. Now
why use KG's?

142
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:13,325
I I like to to
give a very simple

143
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:14,445
answer to this question.

144
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:16,225
I think there are
people who are,

145
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,410
who give very
complicated answers

146
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,010
to this question where we try

147
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,450
to find I I think
they are trying

148
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,490
to answer the question,

149
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,510
what are the applications
of KG's?

150
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,590
I think that is
a different question.

151
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,370
The question I want to address

152
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,275
is why do we have knowledge

153
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,815
graphs to begin with?

154
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,995
And it's in order
to answer that,

155
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,595
we should first see what if we

156
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:39,995
didn't have knowledge
graphs. Right?

157
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:41,295
So what else is there?

158
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:43,515
And there's a broad
spectrum of things,

159
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,195
you know, so I I
I'm only showing

160
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:45,935
two extremes.

161
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,830
One of the extremes is,

162
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,670
natural language. Right?

163
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,790
So this is something that is

164
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,930
very good for humans.

165
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,150
So human readability is very

166
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,150
high for this
where, you know,

167
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,030
you just read it.

168
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,515
You know, you don't
need, you know,

169
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:01,035
most people can
read and write.

170
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,475
Right? So you can
just read this

171
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:03,995
and it may it makes
sense to you.

172
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,375
You don't have to think about

173
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:06,795
the meaning of every word.

174
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,395
You don't have to
parse the grammar.

175
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:10,095
It's just happening
very naturally

176
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,850
in your brain, you know,

177
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,070
something we don't appreciate

178
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,890
often enough. But there's no

179
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,070
other animal in
the animal kingdom

180
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,390
that can do it, and we can.

181
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,950
So, you know, there's
human readability.

182
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,950
So this is natural language.

183
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,735
And then on the left
hand side,

184
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,355
you have this kind
of very highly

185
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,255
structured dataset, you know,

186
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,015
with a very formal
schema, you know,

187
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,135
whether that's a relational

188
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:34,215
database model or
some other schema,

189
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,975
but there's usually
a very formal

190
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,235
schema where everything
is prescribed.

191
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,420
You know? So the usually,

192
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,300
these are tables,

193
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,740
and these things
you see in here,

194
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,720
it's very small.

195
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,580
But this is
a a company, model.

196
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,600
So you have a category,
suppliers,

197
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,440
order details, customers,

198
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,275
and you have things
like product ID,

199
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:54,195
product name, category ID.

200
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,235
So there's a lot of,

201
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,955
very formal semantics
on the left

202
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,795
hand side, whereas
on the right

203
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,815
hand side, you
have very informal

204
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,715
semantics. It's
not really clear

205
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,175
what the semantics are.

206
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,340
How do we understand why we

207
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,800
understand this
kind of document?

208
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
It's it's actually a very

209
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,400
complicated problem,
believe it or not.

210
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,980
Philosophers have
grappled with

211
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,040
it over the centuries.

212
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,740
You know, cognitive scientists

213
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,340
are there's an entire field in

214
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,800
cognitive science
and psychology

215
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,455
that looks at language,

216
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:24,515
that why do we why are we able

217
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,035
to understand
language and work

218
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,975
with language in
the way that we do?

219
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,355
Now knowledge graphs actually

220
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:31,415
fall in the middle,

221
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,835
and I think that's what makes

222
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:33,895
them very attractive.

223
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,590
Because on the one hand,

224
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,630
we don't need the kind of

225
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,910
structure that we
have on the left

226
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,510
hand side. So we can have very

227
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,430
semi structured kind of data,

228
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,410
which is incomplete.

229
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,590
You know, there
are some things

230
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,630
are defined, the other things

231
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,530
are not defined.

232
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,190
But at the same time,

233
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,455
there is something
about the knowledge

234
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:50,835
graph that is very natural.

235
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,415
Like, when you look at this

236
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,035
knowledge graph,
right, it's kind of,

237
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,935
again, you don't have to think

238
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,455
about it as much as you would

239
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:58,435
for this table.

240
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,735
So Bob Dylan created a song,

241
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,495
and Bob Dylan was
born in the US.

242
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:03,870
And, you know,
these are fairly

243
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,030
intuitive facts
that you see in

244
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,010
the knowledge graph.

245
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,470
So I like to think
that the the

246
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,830
ideal knowledge graph tries to

247
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,370
capture the best
of both worlds.

248
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,670
And this also leads us to why

249
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,190
the frontier
problem is there,

250
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,825
what makes a knowledge graph

251
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:19,345
challenging, and what
are the frontier

252
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,665
problems in trying to achieve

253
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:24,165
the perfect balance
between these two.

254
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,285
Alright. So have you
seen it before?

255
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:28,785
I think you have, you know,

256
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:30,085
probably many times.

257
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,990
But, again, just
to be complete,

258
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,610
you know, I'm
sure everyone has

259
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,290
seen it because you must have

260
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,890
typed something in Google that

261
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,430
brings out something
like this.

262
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,330
Right? And all of these things

263
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,710
that you see over here,

264
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:44,285
so this thing on
the right hand

265
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,665
side is a knowledge panel.

266
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,485
It comes from
the Google knowledge

267
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,285
graph. The thing on the top

268
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:52,045
where you see the the actual

269
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,325
things to do in San Jose,

270
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,305
which is a query,

271
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,180
is also coming from
the knowledge graph,

272
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,100
but it's linked to
multimodal data.

273
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,320
Right? So there are images.

274
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,700
There's the map, right,

275
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,760
which is also multimodal.

276
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,380
You have other
things that people

277
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,100
have searched for.

278
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,220
You have things
which have been

279
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,200
derived from Wikipedia.

280
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,195
You have things
that are coming

281
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,955
from third party
providers, right,

282
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,555
the hotel rates and so on.

283
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,675
So that there's a,

284
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,375
there's a lot of complicated

285
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,195
things happening when you type

286
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:21,115
in the query,
but we should not

287
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:22,315
lose track of the one thing

288
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,915
which is which
makes all of this

289
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,920
possible, which is that,

290
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
Google and the companies that

291
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
use knowledge graphs for these

292
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,780
kinds of problems
have recognized

293
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
that San Jose is
a is an entity.

294
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,960
It is it it's a thing.

295
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,720
It's not just a set
of characters.

296
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,765
It's not just a string,

297
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,365
which is what it
used to be once

298
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,605
upon a time, but it's
actually a thing.

299
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:45,605
Google can recognize that San

300
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:47,545
Jose corresponds
to an entity,

301
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:49,605
in the real world,

302
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,145
which is in its
knowledge graph.

303
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,830
But it goes much further.

304
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,510
What you can also see is that

305
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,430
the free spaces to
visit is a class

306
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,830
of things. That also it's able

307
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,430
to recognize that this doesn't

308
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,890
correspond to one thing,

309
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,465
but this is the query.

310
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:07,825
So there's a class of things,

311
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,525
which is the places to visit,

312
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,385
and it's the it's
qualified by San Jose.

313
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:13,845
It's linked by San Jose.

314
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:15,105
But, you know, that's really

315
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,385
what the user is asking for.

316
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,965
The user is asking
for a set of things,

317
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,060
and it's qualified by
this other thing,

318
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,280
which is San Jose.

319
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,600
So it's actually
quite sophisticated,

320
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,340
you know, the way
that it arrives

321
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,480
at something like this.

322
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,940
And beyond Google,
there are, you know,

323
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,620
enormous use cases today.

324
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,400
So this this is sort
of the application,

325
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,095
slide, you know,

326
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,215
that who's using the knowledge

327
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,255
gaps and why. Again,

328
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,695
I'm sure you are very familiar

329
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:42,295
with this, but I I do want to

330
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,055
actually see what
what is going

331
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:45,495
on right now so that we can

332
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,595
think about the future,
the frontier.

333
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,110
So in a nonprofit,

334
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,190
you have the Wikidata,
which is,

335
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,210
kind of like almost
like an open

336
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,490
source Google
knowledge graph,

337
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,090
although there's
there's not a direct

338
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,290
connection between them.

339
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,970
But if you ever
needed something

340
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,590
that looked like
an open source

341
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:02,845
Google knowledge graph,

342
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,605
then this is
the closest, I think,

343
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:05,645
that would come to it.

344
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,265
It's a very big crowdsource

345
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,945
knowledge graph that contains

346
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:10,845
a lot of different things that

347
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:11,825
links to Wikipedia,

348
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,245
to other knowledge graphs.

349
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,845
This is an amazing dataset and

350
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:17,290
it's growing. You know,

351
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,970
Microsoft bought LinkedIn and

352
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,730
both of them were
had knowledge

353
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,170
graphs or knowledge graph like

354
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,950
technology even before
the acquisition.

355
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,930
But certainly, there is,

356
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,930
they are very active in in

357
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,355
knowledge graphs
today, as well,

358
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,635
especially the the LinkedIn

359
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:33,175
graph is is quite
sophisticated.

360
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,875
It's not like a normal
social network.

361
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,055
Right? It has lots of
things in it now.

362
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,595
Again, skills,
your connections

363
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:42,510
on LinkedIn, the groups
you belong to.

364
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,110
In general, social media has

365
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,270
become very
sophisticated, and,

366
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,510
all the big social
media companies

367
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,630
have something that looks like

368
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,650
a knowledge graph
under the hood.

369
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,710
Amazon has been very actively

370
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,230
promoting the product
graph, you know,

371
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,130
in many conferences.

372
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,815
I think this is
an amazing thing

373
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,735
for ecommerce. It has really

374
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,415
made other people in ecommerce

375
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:02,555
sit up and take notice,

376
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,315
which I think is very good.

377
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:06,135
And the team is extremely well

378
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:07,835
qualified, very well
known researchers.

379
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,410
They they have done
really amazing work.

380
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,470
Some of the researchers had

381
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,690
worked in Google before.

382
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,510
So, you know, there's a lot of

383
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,870
cross cutting innovation that

384
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,150
has happened over the years.

385
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,590
And even Uber, I mean,

386
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,670
this is a snippet
that I saw in

387
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,650
one of the presentations.

388
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,635
I haven't seen too much on it

389
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:26,255
except that it exists.

390
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:27,995
So we'll have to wait and see

391
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:30,075
to see what happens
and how it uses it.

392
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,075
But I I was very encouraged to

393
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,015
actually see that
even Google and,

394
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:35,915
you know, companies that you

395
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:38,235
wouldn't associate
very strongly with,

396
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:41,140
like, web data or,
you know, a very,

397
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,380
heterogeneous
data such as what

398
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,320
Amazon and LinkedIn
and Wikidata

399
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,220
and Google and all
these company now.

400
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,260
Even they are investing in

401
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,820
knowledge graphs.

402
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,300
And, of course,

403
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,660
there are other health
care companies.

404
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,940
There are other companies.

405
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,980
They are all trying to invest

406
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,435
in knowledge
graphs right now.

407
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,095
So it's a golden
era, I think.

408
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,355
Alright. So now
now I I want to

409
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:01,735
start getting
into the frontier

410
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,175
now that we have
that background

411
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,475
in place. And what I'm showing

412
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,140
you here is is some of you are

413
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,340
probably recognize it.

414
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,700
You know, some others may not

415
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,820
have seen it, although you've

416
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,960
likely heard of it,

417
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,140
which is the Gartner's,
you know,

418
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,000
curve for emerging
technology.

419
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,480
So so Gartner
publishes this for,

420
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,155
several different things.

421
00:13:23,155 --> 00:13:24,435
There's emerging
technologies.

422
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,395
I believe there's one for

423
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:26,355
strategic technology,

424
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,315
something like that.

425
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:29,015
This one is for
emerging technologies.

426
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:31,175
So to specifically look at,

427
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:33,315
technologies that
are more cutting

428
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,240
edge than others.

429
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,780
And as, you know,

430
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,880
not very long ago in
twenty eighteen,

431
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,020
we we saw knowledge
graphs enter

432
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,920
into the picture.

433
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,500
I think before then,

434
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,860
I don't recall seeing it.

435
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,740
Maybe it did show up,

436
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,180
but I certainly do not recall

437
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,220
the phrase knowledge graphs

438
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,915
showing up before
twenty eighteen.

439
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,375
But if it did,
then I'm sure it

440
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,055
must have been in this
early phase also.

441
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:56,895
So according to Gartner,

442
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:57,855
in twenty eighteen,

443
00:13:57,855 --> 00:14:00,175
knowledge graphs
was, you know,

444
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:01,375
on the innovation trigger.

445
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,055
It was, I hadn't
even approached

446
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,395
the peak of inflated
expectations yet,

447
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,360
which is in itself
interesting because,

448
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
the Google knowledge
graph was,

449
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,520
you know, first, publicized,

450
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,280
in twenty eleven.

451
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,940
So this was seven years after

452
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,240
the Google knowledge graph.

453
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,785
And, you know, it's still kind

454
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,245
of just climbing up towards

455
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:24,525
the the peak of,
inflated expectations.

456
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,185
You know? So it's it may even

457
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:27,865
have been a little
bit late, I think,

458
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:31,145
in coming to the,
coming to this curve.

459
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:33,540
And maybe one
reason why why it

460
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,580
started happening in twenty

461
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,340
eighteen is because some of

462
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,860
the NLP and some of the deep

463
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,680
learning tools,

464
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,960
needed to mature
a little bit before,

465
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,620
you know, we realized the full

466
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,380
potential of knowledge gaps.

467
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,980
And we needed to
see what Google

468
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,740
was doing, you know,

469
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,275
what Amazon was doing,

470
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,875
what big companies
are doing so

471
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,555
that we can sort of learn from

472
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,095
the giants in a way,

473
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,155
because they are
investing a lot

474
00:14:56,155 --> 00:14:57,215
into these technologies.

475
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,035
So finally, in
twenty eighteen,

476
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:00,815
we do see knowledge
graphs come up.

477
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,655
Now what happens in
twenty nineteen?

478
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,420
Knowledge graphs climbs
a little bit up.

479
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,580
Right? So that's
good news, I guess.

480
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,320
We also see graph
analytics, which has,

481
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,920
you know, kind
of very suddenly

482
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,660
in a way,

483
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,880
because you don't see graph

484
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,655
analytics anywhere over here.

485
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:21,675
I mean, in this,
twenty eighteen curve,

486
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,415
you know, we're
not seeing there's

487
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:25,115
nothing here about
graph analytics.

488
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,515
Right? But then in
twenty nineteen,

489
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:31,035
you know, we see
graph analytics

490
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,970
and somehow it has
gone all the way.

491
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,970
It has managed to
bypass, you know,

492
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,730
this entire first
portion of the curve,

493
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,510
and it's already
in the peak of

494
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,710
inflated expectations.

495
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,970
But, you know,
I I I think that

496
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,410
the two have to
be thought about

497
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,530
together. I think what was

498
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,795
happening was that because of

499
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,395
Neo four g and some
of the other graph,

500
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,995
databases, you know,

501
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,595
they they sort of
came up and they,

502
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,835
they were they
are closely tied

503
00:15:58,835 --> 00:15:59,715
to knowledge graphs,

504
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,815
but they are they are
also, databases.

505
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,580
Right? So they
it's not just for

506
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,140
knowledge graphs.

507
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
You can put any
graph into some

508
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,680
of these, infrastructures.

509
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,140
And I think that
within a year,

510
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,660
graph analytics really did go

511
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,960
through this amazing journey

512
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,020
where it was just able
to come to this,

513
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:17,505
this path, because of heavy

514
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:21,105
involvement from, from
industry in this.

515
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,465
But knowledge
graphs is climbing

516
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,605
up slowly and steadily.

517
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:25,525
So now we come to
twenty twenty.

518
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,525
Right? This is
where we are now.

519
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
So what do we see?

520
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,580
And now, again,

521
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,860
something really
interesting has

522
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,420
happened, which is
that, you know,

523
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,980
once more, you know,

524
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,160
now we're seeing
ontologies and graphs.

525
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,195
You know? And so
it's not we're

526
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:43,295
not seeing, graph analytics.

527
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:44,975
We're not seeing
knowledge graphs,

528
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:47,115
but we're seeing
ontologies and graphs.

529
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,875
And it's like, you know,

530
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,315
these two things got combined

531
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:52,335
and then it slid down
a little bit more,

532
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,730
And then now we're
here. Right?

533
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,890
So it's kind of
confusing, I think,

534
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,010
a little bit. Right?

535
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,690
Which is that, you know,

536
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,910
what's happening here?

537
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,050
You know, how how
can something

538
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,430
go in just three years?

539
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:06,825
You know, first
year, then there,

540
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,505
then a little bit down,
a little bit up.

541
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:09,305
You know, we don't know what

542
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,025
will happen this year.

543
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:10,985
Will it even show up?

544
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,505
Is it now on the plateau of

545
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,125
productivity? You don't know.

546
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,045
So it's kind of
an interesting,

547
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,440
you know, it seems
like the consulting

548
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,880
companies can't really make up

549
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,480
their minds on this is,

550
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,080
how I think about it.

551
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,680
And it really depends on what

552
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
they are looking
at, you know,

553
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,320
what applications
they are looking at,

554
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,540
who they're talking to.

555
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:31,855
You know, it's
really not clear

556
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:33,135
because you can ask some other

557
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,255
people and they will tell you

558
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:35,295
that it's on the plateau of

559
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,575
productivity,
that it's already

560
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:37,875
crossed the hype cycle.

561
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,375
I it might even have crossed

562
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,535
the hype cycle as
early as twenty

563
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:42,915
seventeen or twenty eighteen,

564
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,980
and that now it's actually on

565
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,200
the plateau of productivity.

566
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,420
So, you know, take
this with a grain

567
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,720
of salt. I mean, basically,

568
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,960
if you see this
again next year,

569
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,620
we will see another curve like

570
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,740
it next year, you know,

571
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,120
not too far from today.

572
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,415
We don't know where it might

573
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:00,095
show up and might
disappear from

574
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:01,075
the globe altogether.

575
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,455
So, I think we
have to take this

576
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:04,675
with a grain of salt,

577
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:06,895
but the encouraging
thing about

578
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,495
this is that it
does seem to be

579
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,970
progressing. Right?

580
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,090
I mean, that is the one thing

581
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,970
that we see over here,

582
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,850
that it is progressing.

583
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,790
It started from
the innovation trigger,

584
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,130
then, you know,
kind of went up,

585
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,890
fluctuated, and is now sort of

586
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,370
coming down.

587
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,770
And, you know, it's it's,

588
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,330
we are really in
a at a time when,

589
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:26,565
this is starting to
become very mature.

590
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,265
And we are seeing a lot of,

591
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:32,385
applications and
a lot of people

592
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,745
involved in this and a lot of

593
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,985
companies offering,
products and,

594
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:37,345
you know, a lot of companies

595
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,225
developing their own,

596
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,070
knowledge graphs and knowledge

597
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,930
graph technologies
under the hood

598
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,050
behind the scenes.

599
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,630
So it's a it's a,

600
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,650
there's a lot going on.

601
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,070
And the other thing I want to

602
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,430
point out very briefly is that

603
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,870
knowledge graphs
are really not

604
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,390
that new. This is
something that

605
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,645
is not surprising
to anyone who has,

606
00:18:58,365 --> 00:19:00,945
been in AI or NLP
for a while.

607
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:02,525
In fact, you you go back to

608
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,785
the nineteen ninety
one or even before,

609
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,305
and there were
these conferences,

610
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,905
the the message understanding

611
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:10,360
conference, which was a DARPA

612
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,580
funded conference.

613
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,880
And these were trying
to construct,

614
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,660
what they call
knowledge bases.

615
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,960
Even as far as
the early nineties,

616
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,000
they were trying to extract

617
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,400
information and
using NLP tools,

618
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,605
developing NLP
tools to extract

619
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,145
information from text.

620
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,205
And at at that time,

621
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:28,485
we call it knowledge bases.

622
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:29,765
So if you go back
and read some

623
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:32,245
of the NLP tables
from last twenty,

624
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,365
thirty years, you'll see that

625
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:34,645
the term knowledge base is

626
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:35,945
actually not that uncommon.

627
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,790
And, you know, so it's been

628
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,890
around actually,
especially in in NLP.

629
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,170
Now today, there are multiple

630
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,090
fields that are involved.

631
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,150
So I suspect there are some of

632
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,690
you who are coming
from the semantic

633
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,595
website. The
Symantec web likes

634
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,035
to think sometimes that it has

635
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,395
a monopoly on
knowledge graphs,

636
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:55,775
which is not at all true.

637
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,515
I, in particular,

638
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,195
like to fight against it even

639
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,415
when I attend
the conferences,

640
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,035
which is that, sure,

641
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,295
they they have
formalized some of the,

642
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,170
aspects of knowledge graphs,

643
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,370
like ontology and so on.

644
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,050
We have made a lot of
progress on that.

645
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,510
We have modules like RDF,

646
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,110
but they don't
have a monopoly.

647
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,130
You know, we have the NLP,

648
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,350
as I was just saying,

649
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,895
which is which had also been

650
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,255
working on knowledge bases and

651
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,515
knowledge base
construction for a while.

652
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,095
Even before that, you know,

653
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,015
the AI community
has been working

654
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:27,955
on graphs for well
before that.

655
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:29,235
So it's a village.

656
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,495
You know, it's not there's no

657
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,235
one community.

658
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,550
And and that, I hope,

659
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,850
will be a very key takeaway

660
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,670
because you can't if you if

661
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,350
you're only assuming
the semantic

662
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,270
web definition of a knowledge

663
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,050
graph or only
the NLP definition

664
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,250
of a knowledge graph,

665
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,990
then you're missing
out on a very

666
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,130
big part of the community.

667
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:48,255
And to truly know
the frontier,

668
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,775
you have to look
at what everyone

669
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,695
is doing because, you know,

670
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,615
that it's we can't
ignore, you know,

671
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,935
just because, we are not from

672
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,015
that community or
this community or,

673
00:20:58,015 --> 00:20:59,615
you know, we can't
ignore the work

674
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:01,215
that has been
done in the other

675
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:02,810
communities. So there are lots

676
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,590
of people working
on this concept,

677
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,350
sometimes under
different names.

678
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,130
And so there's been a lot more

679
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,570
progress than we would like to

680
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,250
think because sometimes they

681
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,410
will cover a problem
in NLP that

682
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,170
is much better understood in

683
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,310
the semantic web.

684
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,045
Or sometimes in
the semantic web,

685
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,245
they will try to come up with

686
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,605
things that that are actually

687
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,845
much better
understood than NLP

688
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,445
and data mining
in some other,

689
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:29,065
communities. So with that,

690
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,065
what is the five
year frontier?

691
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,500
You know, given that so much

692
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,880
work has already happened,

693
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,280
we are we already have systems

694
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
for extracting
knowledge graphs,

695
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,020
for, querying
knowledge graphs.

696
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,560
You know, all of
that has been,

697
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:47,805
you know, applied as
well as research.

698
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,205
So what is the five
year frontier?

699
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,765
I think the the the first,

700
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,065
the most important thing and

701
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,285
something which is immediate,

702
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:57,725
which is already happening,

703
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,480
but it will take four to five

704
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,500
years for it to
truly materialize

705
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,940
in a very big way,

706
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,160
where it becomes
commonplace. You know?

707
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,540
So once it becomes
commonplace,

708
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,520
you know, that's
when we know that,

709
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,280
yes, you know,
it's, it's here.

710
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,660
It's done. It's
not the frontier

711
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,420
anymore. It's inside
the frontier.

712
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,875
And I think that is to broaden

713
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,335
the scope of
knowledge graphs.

714
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,795
So, here are three that that

715
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:20,915
especially excite me.

716
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:23,155
I I I only work
on one of them.

717
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:24,195
I mean, although I want to get

718
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:25,255
into another one.

719
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,235
But here are the three that I

720
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:29,015
think are really ripe
for disruption.

721
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,980
One of them is KGs
for manufacturing.

722
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,200
Here we are thinking
about the three

723
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,560
d printing companies.

724
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,780
We're thinking about Siemens,

725
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,820
the big manufacturing
companies.

726
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,640
They collect a lot of data.

727
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,320
They have invested
a lot in IoT,

728
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,460
Internet of Things.

729
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:46,525
I think the five g revolution

730
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:48,105
is also going to
be very big for

731
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,485
them for that reason.

732
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,465
So they have a lot of data.

733
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:52,745
You know, they are investing

734
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:53,945
more and more in
machine learning

735
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:54,685
and robotics.

736
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:58,590
And so what does it take to

737
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,950
actually build
a knowledge graph

738
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,610
for manufacturing?

739
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,190
Because it's it's
a very different

740
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,630
kind of knowledge
graph. Right?

741
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,070
It's not like
the web knowledge

742
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,430
graph where you extract things

743
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,950
from Wikipedia
pages and you put

744
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,170
them in a search engine.

745
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:10,785
But this this knowledge graph

746
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:11,585
will be very different.

747
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,665
It will have time
series data.

748
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:16,705
It will have, numbers
and units and,

749
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:20,545
you know, time stamped
entities and,

750
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,785
you know, just a lot
of data which is,

751
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,060
which has very
unusual model of

752
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,900
semantics than than what we

753
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,580
would normally
expect a knowledge

754
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,400
graph to have.

755
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,200
There's KGs in legal domains.

756
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,580
This one is exciting
because, you know,

757
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,940
the legal profession
has become

758
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,760
very complicated.

759
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,435
You know, more and more legal

760
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:42,795
firms are actually moving to

761
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:43,915
the model where they're trying

762
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,835
to save money. So
they are willing

763
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:47,275
to invest in technology that

764
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,715
will allow them to save money

765
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:51,850
on legal research
and, you know,

766
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,390
finding things that
are relevant.

767
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,450
So I I think we are there are

768
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,050
a number of companies
that already

769
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,690
in here.

770
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,950
They are primarily NLP based,

771
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,770
but I think we will we will

772
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,290
start to see a lot
more knowledge

773
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,095
graphs, especially
for international

774
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,155
law firms for, you know,

775
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,355
some of the law
firms that work

776
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,655
in many different markets.

777
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:13,435
And then KG is for health and

778
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:14,875
epidemiology.
This, of course,

779
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,720
is very big right now. Right?

780
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,280
And, in fact, on this
point, you know,

781
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,860
we recently
published an article

782
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,900
where we discussed,

783
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
it's kind of almost
like an opinion

784
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,420
piece, but it's
more scientifically

785
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,400
written, which
is that what are

786
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,765
the opportunities
for knowledge

787
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:32,065
gaps in COVID nineteen.

788
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,625
And, you know,
we it was really

789
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:37,565
encouraging to find that when

790
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:39,325
we wrote this in
early twenty twenty,

791
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:40,525
by the time it got published,

792
00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:41,665
which was very recent,

793
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,370
there are already
three or four

794
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,450
different big
implementations that had,

795
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,690
for COVID nineteen
knowledge graphs.

796
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,770
People had released
a lot of data on,

797
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,150
COVID nineteen.

798
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,490
And, there's a silver lining

799
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,550
behind this pandemic.

800
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,050
It's it's really shown us that

801
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,865
the world is ready to,

802
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:01,705
adopt new technology,
you know,

803
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,405
including the web
conferencing,

804
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:07,465
the the, user machine
learning for,

805
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:08,845
various things.

806
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,725
We have seen progress
in education

807
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:13,645
and government and
all kinds of things,

808
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,280
And I don't think
we'll go back.

809
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,680
Like, you know,

810
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,380
once this pandemic is over,

811
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
some of what we
had before will

812
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,240
come back. That's
what everyone

813
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,200
is saying. You know,

814
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,140
everyone can't stay
isolated forever.

815
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
But a lot of
things that we are

816
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
doing now is actually going to

817
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,780
is here to stay.

818
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,645
Now the other one for the five

819
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:33,065
year frontiers, KG
is for social good.

820
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,245
This is something that,

821
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:36,085
some of us are very
interested in,

822
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:38,425
but it's it's growing.
It's growing.

823
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,645
On the right hand side,

824
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:42,300
what you're seeing
over here is

825
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,280
from McKinsey.

826
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,260
You know, this is,

827
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
something that
McKinsey put out in,

828
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,040
fairly recently.

829
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,640
And what they tried to do was

830
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,700
to figure out, you know,

831
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,225
all of these
different AI tools.

832
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:59,545
Can they be applied
to these domains?

833
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:02,245
And, to, to what
extent can they

834
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:03,365
be applied? And
so if it's like

835
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:05,045
a big circle, that
means the application

836
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:06,345
is quite big. It's higher.

837
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,085
And I want to
point you to just

838
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,810
two things, which
are, you know,

839
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,970
language understanding,
which is,

840
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,730
you know, natural
language processing,

841
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,770
which are very intimately

842
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,290
connected to
knowledge graphs,

843
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,810
but also deep learning on

844
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,790
structured data.

845
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,330
You everyone here
or most people

846
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,785
have probably heard the recent

847
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,065
news that came
out of DeepMind,

848
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:26,585
right, where they were able to

849
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,745
solve a problem
that many people

850
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:30,425
said are are decades away from

851
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:31,145
being solved, you know,

852
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:32,845
which is a protein
folding problem.

853
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:35,225
That is an example of deep

854
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,685
learning on structured data.

855
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,020
You know, but we
also have deep

856
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,820
learning on tables.

857
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,180
We have deep learning
on knowledge

858
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,700
graphs. So there's
a this one,

859
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,160
I think this is
very exciting,

860
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,640
and we will see
a lot more to it.

861
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,780
So somehow even
though you don't

862
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,480
see the freeze
knowledge graphs,

863
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:52,105
the knowledge graphs
are, you know,

864
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,105
they are, they
are very relevant

865
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,305
to two or three
different fields

866
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:56,905
over here. So I think this is

867
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,105
very exciting, and this is

868
00:26:58,105 --> 00:26:59,705
something where we
are doing a lot

869
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,845
of work. So what's
the tenure frontier?

870
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,510
I think the, you know,

871
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,290
the the single
biggest question

872
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,630
that we are dealing with right

873
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,110
now as a community is that,

874
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,970
what is knowledge?

875
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,370
You know, so this is a problem

876
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,350
that it's best not to get into

877
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,050
a deep discussion about it,

878
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:21,205
But I think this diagram here

879
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:22,825
hopefully conveys to you,

880
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:25,445
why it's a complicated
question,

881
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,285
especially in this era where

882
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,125
everyone has
an opinion and it's

883
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,645
it's very difficult
to separate

884
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:33,050
the opinion from
the facts. Right?

885
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,650
So we are some
people are saying

886
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,370
we are in a post
truth era. Right?

887
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,370
And, we have social media that

888
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,490
that you know, everyone just

889
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,870
sometimes we have
contradictions.

890
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,010
We have conspiracy theories.

891
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,570
You have sarcasm.
You have beliefs.

892
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,895
You have all kinds of things.

893
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,135
So, even though this
is from philosophy,

894
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,415
I think you will
recognize that

895
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:52,795
there's everything
from guesses

896
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:55,895
to nonsense to knowledge,
which is very,

897
00:27:56,615 --> 00:27:57,735
strong knowledge, you know,

898
00:27:57,735 --> 00:27:59,275
kind of like
scientific knowledge.

899
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:00,375
There's, you know,

900
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,575
all the things that are true,

901
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:03,435
but people don't want
to believe them.

902
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,970
They are just pure beliefs.

903
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,610
There's knowledge,

904
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,970
which is kind of very fuzzy.

905
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,610
It's very informed.
You can't define it.

906
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,990
You can't describe it.

907
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,810
You know, and then there's

908
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,330
knowledge and
memory, you know,

909
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,570
and so on. So it's
a it's a hard

910
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,430
problem. What do we
mean by knowledge?

911
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:20,675
What goes into our
knowledge graph?

912
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:21,935
How do we qualify it?

913
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,555
How do we reason about it?

914
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:25,135
You know, because so far,

915
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,255
we're kind of
just dealing with

916
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:28,335
this portion in the middle and

917
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,195
a very narrow subset of that.

918
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,310
And then the other problem is

919
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,310
the semantics. So
if you remember

920
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,270
at the very beginning,

921
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,030
the definition I had given was

922
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,810
that a knowledge graph
is a multiracial

923
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,450
directed labeled graph
with semantics.

924
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,030
But now the question is,

925
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,010
what is semantics?

926
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,850
What's the meaning
of meaning?

927
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,245
Again, it turns
out the semantic

928
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,185
web community has an ontology

929
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,605
or a schema where
they say that

930
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:55,125
here's the ontology
and the knowledge

931
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,645
graph is defined according to

932
00:28:56,645 --> 00:28:58,645
the ontology, and
they are really

933
00:28:58,645 --> 00:28:59,765
coming at it from the very

934
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:01,225
structured side
of the equation.

935
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,850
But then the NLP
people are seeing,

936
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,370
well, you know,
the the you know,

937
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,330
these word embeddings,

938
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,470
the deep learning tools,

939
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,150
they have a very different

940
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,430
conception of semantics.

941
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,490
And what they are
saying is that

942
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,875
that word such as
quark is the meaning

943
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,875
of this word can
only be understood

944
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,235
if you know what
the context of

945
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,155
the word is. So here we have

946
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:22,435
three quarks from
Master Mark.

947
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,455
This is from the novels
Fennegan Smith,

948
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,895
an unreadable novel.

949
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,215
Quark, one of
the most influential

950
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:30,230
and modern for
all for all those

951
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,190
of you who are from,

952
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,270
who are Star Trek
fans as I am,

953
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,790
this is a character
on Star Trek.

954
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,330
For for those of you
who are physicists,

955
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,350
quark's and have
obviously a meaning

956
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,430
in physics, but quark is also

957
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,410
a French cheese.

958
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,535
You know, I'm sure there are

959
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:45,675
other meanings as well.

960
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:47,815
So it's not so clear that we

961
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,095
actually get something out of

962
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:50,615
a word sitting in isolation or

963
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:52,395
even a concept sitting
in isolation.

964
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,955
The the context is
very important.

965
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,770
And here, this slide
is from Adobe.

966
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,190
Not the slide, but the figure

967
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,050
is from Adobe. But basically,

968
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,150
the the what they
are, you know,

969
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,170
what what I think
can be understood

970
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,330
from what, everyone
is discussing

971
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,015
about context is that this is

972
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:12,155
a tenure problem.

973
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:13,735
To understand context,

974
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:14,955
to understand semantics,

975
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,055
to understand knowledge,

976
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,515
these are very hard problems.

977
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:19,975
And if we are able to do it,

978
00:30:19,975 --> 00:30:22,375
if ultimately our AI and our

979
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,315
knowledge graphs
are context aware,

980
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,100
then we will be
able to perceive

981
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,100
at the same level
as a human does.

982
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,520
And the word
perceive here should

983
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,900
be construed very broadly,

984
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,820
where we are able
to see something

985
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,160
or read something.

986
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
And it's not just a word or

987
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,240
the the immediate, impact,

988
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,680
but we will be able to see it

989
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,975
in its context.

990
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:42,475
And we'll be able
to understand

991
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:43,435
it in its context,

992
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:45,615
which right now we
are not able to do.

993
00:30:46,315 --> 00:30:47,915
And then just one or two more

994
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:49,435
slides and I'll stop
for questions.

995
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:50,895
I know I'm running over time.

996
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:53,775
But here's my fifteen
year frontier.

997
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
And this is I I won't even try

998
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,100
to go beyond that.

999
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,460
And, you know, it's not clear

1000
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,460
whether this
fifteen year the,

1001
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,980
you know, the longer
you go out,

1002
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,780
you know, the more,

1003
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,940
uncertain things
become. Right?

1004
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,220
So we don't know
if this fifteen

1005
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,500
year is actually
a fifteen year

1006
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,835
frontier or it's,

1007
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,195
it might actually get done in

1008
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:11,395
eight years. We
just don't know.

1009
00:31:11,395 --> 00:31:13,555
It's extremely uncertain where

1010
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:14,695
this frontier lies.

1011
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:18,435
But I do believe
that, you know,

1012
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:20,135
the the conversation around

1013
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,390
artificial
general intelligence

1014
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,750
is very much active.

1015
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,510
You know, a lot of people are

1016
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,010
off the view that we are kind

1017
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,530
of now moving into this,

1018
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,390
EGI era because,
you know, the ANI,

1019
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:34,635
the artificial narrow
intelligence,

1020
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:37,175
you know, we're
kind of there.

1021
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,935
You know, we have
very good tools now,

1022
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:40,315
you know, the deep
learning tools.

1023
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:41,575
The ANI, you know,

1024
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:43,415
the deep mind tool
like you just saw,

1025
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:44,855
the protein folding,
you know,

1026
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:46,820
you might wanna
look that up or

1027
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,700
the Go playing,
you know, AlphaGo,

1028
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,780
which can be Grandmaster.

1029
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,520
Those are all
examples of narrow

1030
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,120
intelligence. The
reason is they

1031
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,820
are very good at
that one task.

1032
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,260
Right? But you can't actually

1033
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,860
turn them onto other tasks,

1034
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:01,755
not without significant
recraining,

1035
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:04,615
redoing. A nice story about

1036
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:05,735
the protein folding one,

1037
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:07,815
if you look deep
into it, is that,

1038
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:09,255
you know, it turns
out that that

1039
00:32:09,255 --> 00:32:10,775
the DeepMind team actually had

1040
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:12,315
to work on that
for two years.

1041
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:13,815
So when they first started on

1042
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,675
that problem almost
two years ago,

1043
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,230
the first system
that they came

1044
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,670
out with for
protein folding was

1045
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,630
really not that great.

1046
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,150
It was good, but it was it

1047
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,350
wouldn't have made the news in

1048
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,130
the way that this
system just did.

1049
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,590
So they they they
in interviews,

1050
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,790
they said that they had to go

1051
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,990
back to the drawing
board a lot

1052
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,190
of times. They had to redesign

1053
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,875
the network. Then they
had to clean it.

1054
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,475
They had to do a lot
of trial and error,

1055
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,015
and they had to do
a lot of cleaning,

1056
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:37,595
which they can do because they

1057
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:38,735
have all those resources.

1058
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,435
But basically,
they had to really

1059
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:43,035
approach the problem
from a very

1060
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:44,015
ANI perspective.

1061
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,790
But we're now starting to move

1062
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,550
into this field where we are

1063
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,910
looking more and
more in general

1064
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,950
intelligence. What do we need

1065
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,710
to do to build an AI that can

1066
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,910
do many different things at

1067
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,070
the same time, and
what will that take?

1068
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,670
And then can we even
reach this point?

1069
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,870
So this it's very uncertain

1070
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,170
whether we will get here,

1071
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:02,535
or how long it will take.

1072
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,875
And then there is this thing

1073
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,235
called a singularity event.

1074
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,675
This is where I think we start

1075
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:07,895
moving to science fiction,

1076
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,835
but we never know,
which is that,

1077
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,135
you know, the super
intelligence.

1078
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:13,315
You know, some
people say, well,

1079
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:14,995
you know, this is coming.

1080
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:15,715
This is coming.

1081
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:17,530
But we first need to come here

1082
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,890
and then we have
to come here.

1083
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,070
Right? So in order
to come from

1084
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,350
ANI to AGI,

1085
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,250
there are all
these things that

1086
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,090
just listed six six
different things,

1087
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,930
but there are many
more that all

1088
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,910
need to be solved.

1089
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:30,395
You know, so
causal knowledge,

1090
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,735
the, you you know,
the common sense,

1091
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,015
which is something
we are working on.

1092
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,155
It's a four year program.

1093
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:39,895
Context, which I
sort of, you know,

1094
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:41,495
being context
aware is the four

1095
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:42,775
is the five year sorry,

1096
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:43,835
a ten year problem.

1097
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,650
But then if you
want to explain

1098
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,110
the explain our outputs based

1099
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,150
on the context and so on,

1100
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,830
that's maybe another
five years.

1101
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,910
How can AI adapt to novelty,

1102
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,430
something it has
never seen before,

1103
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,730
not even from a distributional

1104
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,715
standpoint? You know,

1105
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:00,715
how do we reason about
events and time?

1106
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:01,435
Theory of mind,

1107
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:02,875
how do we reason about other

1108
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,775
people's beliefs?

1109
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:05,995
This is something we are very

1110
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:07,755
good at doing, but animals are

1111
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,295
are not that good at doing.

1112
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,880
How do we get
a machine to do that?

1113
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,720
So there are lots
of interesting,

1114
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,520
questions that have
to be answered.

1115
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,820
And, with knowledge
graphs, you know,

1116
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,440
these are very closely related

1117
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,655
to knowledge graphs
because, you know,

1118
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:25,655
the the if we are
able to solve

1119
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:27,895
some of these issues, then,

1120
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:29,975
we would need to do it for our

1121
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,015
knowledge graphs as well.

1122
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,375
So, you know, common sense is

1123
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,415
kind of knowledge. Right?

1124
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:34,695
We have a lot of facts about

1125
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:36,315
the world in our head,

1126
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,150
and that presumably can be

1127
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,010
represented as
a knowledge graph.

1128
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,830
Similarly, when we have,

1129
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,910
something like
causal knowledge,

1130
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,590
we can represent
this as a knowledge

1131
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,750
graph. But how do we
make the knowledge

1132
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,495
graph more causal? Right?

1133
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,255
And so that's
it's they're very

1134
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,535
tied together. So I think by

1135
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:53,755
the time we get here,

1136
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:57,175
the boundary between
the knowledge

1137
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,415
graph and the general AI will

1138
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:00,375
have blurred. They will have

1139
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,980
become one and
the same because,

1140
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,660
we need them. It's like you

1141
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,360
you're not different
from your memory.

1142
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,020
Right? You can't
totally separate

1143
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,300
a lot of things
that is that are

1144
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000
in your brain. They
kind of go together.

1145
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,900
So I think that
is where the true

1146
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
fifteen year framework lies.

1147
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,140
Combining the knowledge graph

1148
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,960
with the reasoning,

1149
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,595
the the actual intelligence,

1150
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:19,655
it all has to come together in

1151
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:20,635
a single architecture.

1152
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:23,195
So with that,

1153
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:26,155
maybe we have time
for a few questions.

1154
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,095
But I'm happy to connect on

1155
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:31,420
LinkedIn with,
anyone who has,

1156
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,660
who has other questions,

1157
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,060
wants to do a deep
dive into this.

1158
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,660
You know, please do reach out

1159
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,560
to me on LinkedIn,

1160
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,460
and we can also we can have

1161
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,920
broader discussions,
Darren as well.

1162
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,785
Thank you, Mayank.

1163
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:50,945
Thank you for your talk.

1164
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:55,725
We do have a couple
questions,

1165
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:58,625
and I see, some
more are coming,

1166
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,300
on the chat. So, Mayank,

1167
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,740
can you can you
read the chat?

1168
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,780
Do you do you want to,

1169
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,560
pick up the questions
yourself?

1170
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,920
Sure. So I think,
one question is,

1171
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,515
do McKinsey and
or others publish

1172
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:17,495
similar charts?

1173
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:19,415
So, Larry, by similar,

1174
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:21,075
I'm I'm I'm assuming that you

1175
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:23,475
are you're you mentioned
a high curve,

1176
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,995
or did you mean
the other one,

1177
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:26,775
the KG's for social guide?

1178
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,120
I think that's
the high curve.

1179
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,480
That's when the you
were showing

1180
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,160
the high curve that
that question came.

1181
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,600
Yeah. I don't
think I I have not

1182
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,380
seen such a slide
from McKinsey.

1183
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,220
I have seen it
from Accenture,

1184
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:41,345
and from Deloitte.

1185
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,785
I think Accenture and Deloitte

1186
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:43,985
definitely come out with,

1187
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,865
I haven't seen
a curve from them.

1188
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,345
I have seen, them see, okay,

1189
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:51,265
what are the what are the top

1190
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:52,645
technology trends?

1191
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,330
I think if I'm
remembering correctly,

1192
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,070
either from Accenture
or Deloitte

1193
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,910
or both, I know that they come

1194
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,070
out with technology
trends, and,

1195
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,090
I have some of them
on my machine.

1196
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,630
But I don't really see a hype

1197
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,750
curve as such that they have

1198
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,970
come out with. I
think Dartmouth

1199
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,375
has really, know,

1200
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:09,655
if anyone else
tries to come out

1201
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:11,175
with that, they
it would probably

1202
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,015
look like they
are imitating and

1203
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:14,855
I'm not sure that that's very

1204
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:16,315
flattering. So,

1205
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:18,775
I haven't seen
a curve like that

1206
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:20,955
from anywhere from
anyone except

1207
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,560
to to be honest.

1208
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,300
So we we have, we
have, people from,

1209
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,440
Deloitte and
Accenture attending

1210
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,060
this conference and and other

1211
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,780
consulting.
