1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,920
Alright. So, let's
get started.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,060
So, greetings, everybody.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,980
My my name is Mike Atkin.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,220
I am the director
of the Enterprise

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,580
Knowledge Graph Foundation.

6
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:15,065
I also work at
a knowledge graph

7
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,225
consulting firm
called Agnos dot

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,365
AI in London.

9
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:20,765
So, on Monday,

10
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:25,065
we organized two
sessions focusing

11
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,005
on the business
and implementation

12
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:31,050
issues kind of
affecting knowledge

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,570
graph adoption. Right?

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,870
We had various viewpoints.

15
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,250
We have participants from

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,910
Accenture and from
AstraZeneca,

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,665
UBS, Capital One,
Johnson and Johnson,

18
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:45,685
a fashion knowledge
graph, called,

19
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:47,785
Zalando, and a fintech,

20
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,665
in financial services
called Noonan.

21
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,285
And we organized
a session around,

22
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:54,965
hypothesis. So let me give you

23
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:55,705
that hypothesis,

24
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,150
and we'll start with that,

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,190
and then we'll get into it.

26
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,870
So, from my perspective, the,

27
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,830
knowledge graph equation kinda

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,150
starts with
the recognition that

29
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,170
we have, data incongruence.

30
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,735
It's a liability.
It's a real problem.

31
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,735
And most people
are recognizing

32
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,375
that problem as
being something

33
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:18,095
to address.

34
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,295
We know the problem
is solvable.

35
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,755
We also know that it's easier

36
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:26,010
to solve this
problem semantically

37
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,130
than it is using conventional

38
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,390
technology. Right?

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,930
We know that making the leap

40
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,290
from columns to concepts
is achievable,

41
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,770
but it's certainly
not automatic.

42
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:40,015
And we also know
that leadership

43
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,595
is required because there's

44
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:43,035
organizational
inertia that you

45
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,875
have to overcome for any new

46
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,715
thing that's introduced into

47
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:47,375
an organization.

48
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:50,635
So the community of knowledge

49
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:51,535
graph practitioners,

50
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,260
we are completely
enamored with,

51
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,720
of course, with the potential

52
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,620
of knowledge graph because of

53
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,020
all the capability provided by

54
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,300
semantic standards. Right?

55
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,280
We know that subject
matter expertise,

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,200
knowledge can be modeled.

57
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:08,225
It can be modeled precisely.

58
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,085
We can express that
in a standard way.

59
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,805
We can achieve
unambiguous shared

60
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,745
meaning, which is
always our goal.

61
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,605
Right? The fact that we can

62
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,825
solve it is
a compelling story.

63
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm gonna say it's
an overwhelmingly

64
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,550
compelling story.

65
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,370
So our goal was
to look at what's

66
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,710
required to expedite adoption

67
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,950
and where are we
in that curve,

68
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,135
and what do we need to do to

69
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,295
continue this movement along

70
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,375
that pathway. So this is gonna

71
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,875
be a summary of
what we learned,

72
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,195
maybe a bit of extra analysis

73
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,035
thrown in if we
feel compelled.

74
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:50,255
And to help me do
that are two people,

75
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,270
so Teresa Tong from
Accenture and,

76
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,070
Lauren Dakiya from,
Johnson and Johnson.

77
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,350
I'll let you guys
introduce yourself,

78
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,230
and then we'll get into it.

79
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,930
So, Teresa, let's
start with you.

80
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,330
Hi. This is Teresa Tongue.

81
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,130
I'm a, managing
director at Accenture.

82
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,165
I'm the chief
technologist within

83
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,545
our cloud first business.

84
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,525
And I've been working with

85
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,205
enterprise knowledge
graphs over

86
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:14,685
the past eight years and most

87
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,525
recently have been doing a lot

88
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,205
more work, bringing it out of

89
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:19,805
pilot into something
that's more

90
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,265
organized across
our business.

91
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,730
Terrific. Morant?
And, Noel Kaye.

92
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,370
I'm I'm, part of
a small team in,

93
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,730
Johnson Johnson around the,

94
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,530
enterprise IT, working
on, everything,

95
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,590
emerging technologies.

96
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,195
And I've been working with,

97
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:42,335
Semantic Technologies
for the past

98
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:43,855
twelve years, mostly.

99
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,875
First as a a a side
project and then,

100
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:49,140
more recently, as a more,

101
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,040
significant part
of, of my work.

102
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,780
And, we're very
early on that,

103
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,320
on the other journey
around the.

104
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,100
Alright. So, Teresa,

105
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,780
you've agreed to be
my first victim.

106
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,380
We're gonna talk
about the business

107
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,360
side of the equation.

108
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,225
And there were there
were, I think,

109
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,325
like, four big topics that

110
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:07,685
occurred in the conversation.

111
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:10,165
The first one was
about cognition.

112
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,765
Right? It was about,

113
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:15,105
do stakeholders
really get the joke?

114
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:17,410
Do they understand the data

115
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,210
incongruence
problem at a level

116
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,370
that's gonna lead us into this

117
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,250
type of solution?

118
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,530
What what do you think we what

119
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,910
do we learn from
that conversation?

120
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,970
Yeah. I mean, I
think that that

121
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,510
that's one of
the biggest changes.

122
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,435
Right? So I think the the data

123
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:32,555
incongruence problem,

124
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:33,675
it's always been a problem,

125
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,995
and people have
thought of it as,

126
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:38,155
you know, it it's
it's a manual step.

127
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,355
We'd have to deal with it.

128
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,815
It's it's par for course.

129
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:43,355
And I think the change is that

130
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:44,715
the business stakeholders are

131
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:46,730
not only recognizing
the challenge

132
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,270
as an important
thing to solve,

133
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,710
but as an opportunity.

134
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,090
The need to be data centric is

135
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,690
going to be how they are going

136
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,810
to compete. Right?

137
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,510
So our oil and gas clients,

138
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,050
the way they pull
oil from the ground

139
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,735
and refine it and deliver it,

140
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,355
actually compete upon
how they do that.

141
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:03,710
How they're going
to compete is

142
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,215
the enterprise knowledge graph

143
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,755
is really what's
needed to really

144
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,320
bring the smarts,
bring the agility.

145
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,240
And and these business people

146
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,360
are very savvy. Right?

147
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,440
They they experience
the impact

148
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
of enterprise knowledge graphs

149
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,160
in their consumer
lives. Right?

150
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,320
So when they do
web searches on,

151
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,195
online, when
they're interfacing

152
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:28,915
with the chatbot,

153
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,055
when they're online shopping,

154
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,435
so they they do
wonder why can't

155
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,695
we bring some of
those experiences

156
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:37,875
to how their business. Right?

157
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:38,915
It it's it's Yeah.

158
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:40,435
I was really I
was really taken

159
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:42,000
I was really taken
by that concept

160
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,060
of data centricity.

161
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
You know, that was like a I

162
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,260
think throughout all
the conversations,

163
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
we kinda got the sense that

164
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
people are putting data first

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
as opposed to
technology first.

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
That's a pretty huge shift,

167
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,745
don't you think? It is.

168
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,825
And I think it's part of it is

169
00:05:56,825 --> 00:05:58,425
because of that
intelligence, right?

170
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,045
That, that data
driven business,

171
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,205
to power things like AI.

172
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,045
And even with the pandemic,

173
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:05,865
I would say that it's not so

174
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,145
much just AI. It's, it's,

175
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,165
it's knowing data real time,

176
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,840
seeing a very,

177
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,540
seeing the view you wanna see

178
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,420
about the business.

179
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,640
When something changed,

180
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,020
it's not about
projecting a year

181
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,380
from now. That's
important too.

182
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,760
But what's happening now,

183
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,455
and what can I do about it

184
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:22,775
different part?

185
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:35,300
seeing this from

186
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,980
the same single
source of truth,

187
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,740
but the the view
that you wanna

188
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,520
see is that data centricity.

189
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,340
You know, so we can,

190
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
maybe check a box
and say that,

191
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,465
generally, the,
stakeholders at the,

192
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:51,305
you know, in
charge of business

193
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,485
and organization do understand

194
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,645
this problem and are kind of

195
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:56,985
viewing it in the right way.

196
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,145
So that that's
that's, I think,

197
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,165
progress for our industry.

198
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,970
The second topic, kind
of in my opinion,

199
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,690
was really about
maturity. Right?

200
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,850
And and and we we
kind of framed

201
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,530
it saying, let's look at three

202
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,410
levels of maturity.

203
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,690
We have a maturity model we've

204
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,995
been working on and
kinda just kind of,

205
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:18,375
frame that real quickly.

206
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,935
We have level one,
which is experiments,

207
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:21,975
you know, POCs.

208
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:25,175
You're building
your own specialist

209
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:28,375
team and you're,
doing a project.

210
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:29,955
Right? Somebody is willing to

211
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:31,290
pay for it, but you're
doing a project.

212
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,690
Level two, that's
where it starts

213
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,750
to become extensible.

214
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,270
We've got shared ontologies.

215
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,290
We're beginning
to build a center

216
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,450
of excellence. And
then level three,

217
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,310
when we extend it out
to the enterprise

218
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,185
kind of as a, a platform for

219
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:46,845
the organization.

220
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,885
So, I was,

221
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:53,565
pretty impressed
that the industry

222
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:56,845
has made a leap
from experiments

223
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,380
almost to
the enterprise level.

224
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,140
What what did you
hear in this,

225
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,020
Teresa? Yeah. I I
heard very similar.

226
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,340
I I'm sure part of the reason

227
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,940
we were panelists was because

228
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,440
we we had experience
in the topic.

229
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,415
But all the panelists
were, you know,

230
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:15,175
moving out of level one.

231
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,775
So within their
organizations,

232
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,995
they had pockets where people

233
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:21,155
had already experimented with

234
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:22,675
knowledge graphs
and have proven

235
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,035
the value for knowledge graph

236
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:24,935
powered applications.

237
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,690
So this might be within a line

238
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,470
of business or
within a particular

239
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,350
use case.

240
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,450
And people were
looking towards,

241
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,210
again, returning to
that level too.

242
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,690
Right? So how do
you connect and

243
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,050
across the different parts of

244
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,535
the business that figuring out

245
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,295
how do I make this applicable

246
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:47,195
for my business?

247
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:49,355
How do I make this
enterprise ready?

248
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,815
And I think one of the key

249
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,335
takeaways from the panel was

250
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,780
that you really need
to band together.

251
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Because when you're
in level one,

252
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,160
you can have a strong
business champion.

253
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
That is that's what
you need. Right?

254
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,860
You need a business
champion with that,

255
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
the funding, with the team,

256
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,275
with the use case,
and the the,

257
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,035
the channel to
make a difference

258
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:09,935
for your business.

259
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,235
But then as you move to level

260
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,095
two so that this
doesn't become

261
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,755
a POC and sells there,

262
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,275
but actually
changes the way you

263
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,255
manage your data,

264
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,075
now that banding together is

265
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,175
actually not that
lone champion,

266
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,760
but a federated
coalition across

267
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,200
the business that
is gonna agree

268
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,080
upon certain things.

269
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
And, and some of the things

270
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,640
we're doing is agreeing upon

271
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,400
even the graph
database or even

272
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,500
the query interface,
Gremlin, GraphQL.

273
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,800
Right? So how do we
work with cloud?

274
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,660
Do we use the cloud
cloud graph,

275
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,245
offerings, or do
we do something,

276
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,825
that is more,
migratable? Right?

277
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:45,185
So all these questions as you

278
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,425
band together is
gonna help you,

279
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:49,525
have, you know,
power numbers.

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
Very significant. Right?

281
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,660
Because, previously,

282
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,500
we if in terms of
sustainability,

283
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,280
if you have to
rely on a single

284
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,240
champion and that
champion moves on,

285
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,020
your whole project's at risk.

286
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:04,605
And I think it it
kinda got a sense

287
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,805
that, as you just said,

288
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,905
we kinda are moving
beyond the need

289
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,645
for a sole, skirt
to hide behind,

290
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,065
if you will. Yes.

291
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,570
I was also, pretty,

292
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,970
impressed that I
guess the general

293
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,890
sense was we've moved out of

294
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,650
the academic realm
and now into

295
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,770
the applications realm,

296
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,170
and that's also a big
leap, I think,

297
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,310
that that has occurred.

298
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:36,585
I think the third topic that I

299
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,685
heard was really
about the driving

300
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,485
use cases.

301
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,665
And, you know,

302
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:43,945
maybe I can frame
that a little

303
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,865
bit for you because
I hear two sides.

304
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,740
There's a control
type of activity,

305
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,100
resiliency and organizational

306
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,240
management, and
there's a business

307
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,380
function, you know,

308
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,540
applications that are designed

309
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,500
for revenue and
customer service.

310
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,735
What do you see right now as

311
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,415
the driving applications for

312
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,315
knowledge graph?

313
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:09,495
So it seemed across the board

314
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:12,135
that we saw data
as the driving

315
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,895
application. So data in a lot

316
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:15,410
of ways that that serves some

317
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,410
of that function. Right?

318
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,810
So data and then
inventory of data,

319
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,150
like a new sort of,
data management.

320
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,310
So going beyond your
data glossaries,

321
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,870
to something that
actually manages

322
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,370
the information and,

323
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,830
makes that data reusable.

324
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,775
It's the data integration and

325
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:31,975
using a knowledge
graph to make

326
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:32,935
it easy to both,

327
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:34,535
stitch together
data from others

328
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,735
and to reuse that. Right?

329
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,895
So you're not,
doing it time and

330
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,495
time again, but
you could actually

331
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,335
add the right
quality rules and

332
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:41,815
and really,

333
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,670
manage and and
connect the lineage

334
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,690
of of your data
supply chains.

335
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,190
And then your flexible query,

336
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,030
and this this does
lead into the app,

337
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,550
but it wasn't
driven necessarily

338
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,510
by the app itself.

339
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,790
It's not saying
we're gonna have

340
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,390
a chatbot, and that's
the killer app,

341
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,530
or customer service,

342
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,645
recommendations as
a cut killer app,

343
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,385
the the flexible query that

344
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:03,985
actually is gonna
change a business

345
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:04,785
process. Right?

346
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,165
So if you imagine,

347
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,065
the way that you might do,

348
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,510
even manufacturing
today, right?

349
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,030
Like you would want to be able

350
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,250
to see right away,

351
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,630
all the data that you have as

352
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,230
to what's
manufacturable within

353
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,370
your supply chain.

354
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,590
And a lot of what is needed is

355
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,785
dependent on context.

356
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:24,065
So to even to be able to have

357
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:26,785
a flexible query
that a a business

358
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:29,205
analyst or user could
actually find,

359
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:31,585
that's gonna power a a new set

360
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,105
of applications that's beyond

361
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:34,225
a killer app. Right?

362
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,005
It's actually
the value of itself.

363
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,360
You You know, I
think there was

364
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
a there was
a a seemingly a little

365
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
bit of a dark cloud that hung

366
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,100
over the conversation
because,

367
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
it does require an investment

368
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,180
to become operational,

369
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,580
and you do have to
have some patience.

370
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:51,575
But once you are
operational at

371
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:52,715
that foundation level,

372
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:54,615
I guess the message was it's

373
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:56,395
easier to continue to add,

374
00:12:57,335 --> 00:12:59,355
business driving use cases.

375
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,215
And, you know, what maybe you

376
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,495
call that a semantic hump.

377
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:05,560
It's kind of what
I what I glean

378
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,460
from the conversation.

379
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,240
Is that kind of
reality the way

380
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,480
you see it? I think
it's definitely

381
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
reality, and I
think that's why

382
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,440
you you have
the maturity levels

383
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,220
the way that you
you had specified.

384
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,255
So within your level ones,

385
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,775
you do have people who do take

386
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:20,655
a leap of faith. Right?

387
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:22,255
There's there is somebody who

388
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,175
has to buy into modeling data

389
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:25,235
in its own right,

390
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:27,635
before you go to
the application.

391
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:28,735
And and that's where you're

392
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:30,515
going to actually
build a foundation.

393
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
And I think the sell as far as

394
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
what we started with
the, you know,

395
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,080
realization from the business

396
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,440
is that the sell is actually

397
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,400
easy after that. Right?

398
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,180
So I think people have,

399
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,400
been burned a bit from maybe

400
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
master data management and

401
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,980
traditional data management.

402
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,545
People have, you know,

403
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:49,385
reimplemented the same
data pipelines.

404
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,145
How many of you
have put in maps

405
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:53,625
or put in social media or put

406
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,645
in the same sort
of data sources?

407
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:57,225
And you do this time and time

408
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:58,125
and time again,

409
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,450
and very little
of it is reused.

410
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,850
And, if we talk about
things that are,

411
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,810
you know, even
a data glossary,

412
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,570
we have data stewards
like we do this,

413
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,730
right? But none
of that is easily

414
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,250
reused. A lot of
that is manual,

415
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,290
right? It's very hard when

416
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,010
something changes.

417
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,685
It's a whole another
manual process.

418
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:17,185
And so the sell
as to, you know,

419
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:18,925
get the buy in to say, look,

420
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,205
I I have this already.

421
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,825
I've modeled the concepts.

422
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:23,825
Now this data is
understandable.

423
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,885
People can reuse
it for different

424
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,245
reasons. And if I wanna change

425
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,685
it and I wanna
now think about,

426
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,470
I think they want
an example of

427
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,950
sustainability. People wanna

428
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,230
think about
sustainability now.

429
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,190
That wasn't
something they were

430
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,790
looking at. It
was very easy to

431
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,630
add that label and
to propagate it.

432
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,750
Right? You didn't have to have

433
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,330
a whole other,
big data project.

434
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,765
So forgive me for my German

435
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,205
shepherd alarm
clock going off,

436
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:47,905
but the mail was
just delivered.

437
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:50,765
I think you, you
touched on what

438
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,365
I also heard is
probably the key

439
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:53,265
value proposition,

440
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,065
which is that
reusability of data.

441
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,550
And if there was one theme at

442
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,790
the end of this section of our

443
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,110
conversation, it
was that those

444
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,330
fundamental, knowledge graph

445
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,250
capabilities,
you know, reuse,

446
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,010
meaning resolution,

447
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,355
and all the rest
that really do

448
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,035
win the day. That's kind of

449
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:15,495
where I I walked away feeling

450
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,015
pretty good about
the direction

451
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,895
of that conversation.
For sure.

452
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:21,015
I mean, the value I think

453
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:23,015
everybody agreed
was upon the self

454
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:25,630
describing nature
that the knowledge

455
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,310
graph gives to
our data. Right?

456
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,310
So now I can because we model

457
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,690
the data as it's collected,

458
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,390
if I wanna re examine
it for reuse,

459
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,870
if I even wanna
track back things

460
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,755
around the lineage
and and where

461
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:38,775
it's coming from,

462
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,375
the richness of that metadata

463
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,275
that allows the humans now,

464
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,835
to figure out, does
this concept apply?

465
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,115
Right? So if I'm
getting a reading

466
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:47,315
from a temperature pump and I

467
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:48,375
know how it's measured,

468
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:50,275
there's many ways
that I can use that.

469
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:51,690
Right? But if we actually cast

470
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,210
it right away into
an application,

471
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,390
we lose all that, that,

472
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,550
that value there.

473
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,530
And so the ability
to actually,

474
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,970
capture this in
a way that then

475
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,610
needs to become
democratized for

476
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,945
your normal, you know,

477
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,405
non data scientist,

478
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,545
non data geek to look at,

479
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:12,005
your business user,

480
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:13,905
your insurance agent,
your doctor.

481
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:15,985
Right? I think
that's where I'm

482
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:17,265
really excited
about this because

483
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:18,625
they do think in
those sorts of

484
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,100
conceptual terms,
not, you know,

485
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,380
the traditional
data terms that

486
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,060
we look at right
now. Alright.

487
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,360
So let's shift
the conversation

488
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,380
from the business narrative,

489
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,060
which I think was
a good news story,

490
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,920
you know, which is
it's emerging,

491
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,780
to, implementation reality.

492
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,380
And, Lauren, you've agreed to

493
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,985
be our victim for kind
of the implementation

494
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,405
. I'm gonna bridge
the gap between

495
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,965
this business
narrative and and

496
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,565
implementation.
And let me kinda

497
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,905
pick up from what was maybe

498
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,965
underscoring some
of what Teresa

499
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,425
said just now, which is,

500
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,840
don't focus on
the technology.

501
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,020
Right? This is the you know,

502
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,460
you you don't have
to sell people

503
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,260
on knowledge graph.

504
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,900
We're selling people
on business value.

505
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Right? So how do we make that

506
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,800
that relationship
with the business

507
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,545
user one that is the driving

508
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:07,465
activity in our
conversations?

509
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,525
One way of doing that is about

510
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,705
by making it simple,

511
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:15,625
hiding the semantics,

512
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:16,505
hiding the complexity,

513
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:21,610
and providing simple
lenses into what,

514
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,590
what you've built,

515
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,990
in in your in your
knowledge graph.

516
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,310
So hiding the semantics,

517
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,855
automating everything,

518
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:35,475
you can automate so that you

519
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:39,555
don't you don't
have to involve

520
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,175
people in manual tasks,

521
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:44,675
that that they're not prepare

522
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:45,575
prepare for.

523
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,990
Try to reduce as
much as possible

524
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,290
the need for ontologist.

525
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,030
And you still
need ontologist.

526
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,050
You still need
a a semantic architect,

527
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,370
but, have them,

528
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,105
more on the the the long term

529
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:02,645
vision and the the,

530
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:06,165
in in a role to
avoid pitfalls,

531
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,785
to avoid, issues, and,

532
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,305
lead the day to day,

533
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,290
operations to you know,

534
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,610
in in using tools
that are that

535
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,557
are simple to use.
That's a good idea.

536
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,210
That's a problem
for us. Right?

537
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,730
Because, a lot
of the people in

538
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,490
the community like
to talk about

539
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,450
the technology. Right?

540
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,230
We are we are focused on,

541
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:27,775
breaking new ground,

542
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,955
and we wanna talk
about triples

543
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,455
and semantic, you know,

544
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,655
engineering and the like.

545
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:34,975
And, really, I
think the message

546
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:37,075
was talk about
data visualization

547
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,695
and navigation and
query. Right?

548
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,540
So you probably
are experiencing

549
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
that yourself in
the rollout of,

550
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,900
knowledge graph in
Johnson and Johnson.

551
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
Yeah. We were talking
earlier about,

552
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,140
stories, telling
better stories to,

553
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,475
to share the value of,

554
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:59,635
of of doing it this way.

555
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:02,755
And one thing that
I've run into

556
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,615
is how do you talk about,

557
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:06,755
knowledge graphs and semantic

558
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:09,235
technologies without
using the word

559
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,455
graph and the word semantics?

560
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,210
Forget about the technology or

561
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,770
hide the technology
and focus on what,

562
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,710
what you are trying
to accomplish,

563
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,110
what will be
the the real benefits

564
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,235
of doing it, in in
in a different way.

565
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,975
But if people knew
how wonderful

566
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,295
and important and
magnificent this was,

567
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,275
then they would automatically

568
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:33,335
be the same way
as we are talking

569
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:35,595
about the data concepts
and semantics.

570
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,290
No. No. Just Those who get it

571
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,050
those who get it
and and and are

572
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,430
willing to get into
the technology

573
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,050
often become very
enthusiastic about it.

574
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,790
Yeah. So I think
tell a good story,

575
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,350
and a good story
does not start

576
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,905
with the the word ontology or

577
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,405
the concept of
semantic capability.

578
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:59,545
Right? So the second topic I'm

579
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,405
gonna say was kind
of built on that,

580
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,045
almost a bat a battle
for mind share.

581
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,550
Right? This is, you know,

582
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,430
how do we make knowledge graph

583
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,410
work with existing
infrastructures.

584
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,230
Right? Because
there are existing

585
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,590
infrastructures. They're not

586
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,690
gonna rip and replace them,

587
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,150
and we have to blend this.

588
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,615
So what do we learn
about the ability

589
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,595
to blend semantic
technology with,

590
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:27,755
legacy environments?

591
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,570
We're here to you,

592
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,270
you have to make it fit with,

593
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,570
with existing
environment, and,

594
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,350
that's one of
the the beauty of,

595
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,430
of, of the the approach
is that

596
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,935
it doesn't have
to disturb what's

597
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:49,275
already there. You
can, automatically,

598
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,575
I mean, you can you can set up

599
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:53,895
automatic processes
that extract

600
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,995
the data, that
promotes data, that,

601
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:59,435
organize the data
into into a graph

602
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,930
without, touching
what's what's

603
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:03,830
already in place.

604
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,810
And the That
abstraction layer.

605
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,650
I think you you
you you described

606
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,750
it as an abstraction
layer, which is,

607
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,570
I think, was maybe
one of the key

608
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,750
themes that I heard
in the conversation.

609
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:15,145
Yeah. In that sense,

610
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:17,405
the the knowledge
was are, a map,

611
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:20,905
linking together
the the the physical

612
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,005
the the the physical
infrastructure,

613
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:25,785
the physical data data storage

614
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,925
or the data documentation.

615
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,830
And, one thing I've
seen is a it's

616
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,490
a I've seen some
some investment

617
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,130
fatigue or rec
reluctance to to

618
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,050
invest into yet
another platform

619
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,975
because a few years ago,

620
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:44,895
we we had to invest
to do big data,

621
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:46,755
and then we had
to invest to do,

622
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,795
data lakes, or or
data warehouses

623
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,935
along the way. And now you're

624
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,975
telling me that there wasn't

625
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:54,095
enough you needed to do,

626
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,340
that stuff on top of it.

627
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,500
And, so that that's, again,

628
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,780
part of telling the story and

629
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,460
showing that, yes,

630
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,380
you need you need that to to

631
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,980
make it fit and make it work

632
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,440
better at a larger scale,

633
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,025
but it doesn't
detract from what

634
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:10,905
you've done before.

635
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,445
It just builds on top of it.

636
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,365
But this is
the difference between

637
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,205
data processing technology

638
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,685
orientation and data meaning

639
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:20,125
content orientation.

640
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,105
We're now talking
about the content

641
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:23,390
side of the equation. Right?

642
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,630
Your poor, humble
data is finally

643
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,550
getting its due.
Right? You know?

644
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,590
And it would have been a lot

645
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,510
harder to do without
the data lakes,

646
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,130
without the data
data warehouses

647
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,930
and so on.

648
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,390
I think it was
you who described

649
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,810
it that there is
a challenge, however,

650
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,175
that you have to
overcome the relational

651
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,155
masses. I think
that was a a quote

652
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,795
that I heard used
frequently. Right?

653
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:48,355
The skill sets of how to get

654
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:51,095
people to move
into the semantic

655
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,250
world are not really easy to

656
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,570
come by and are not present at

657
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,810
the moment in
organizations. Yes.

658
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,970
And that's it's not
only a skill set,

659
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,590
but it's also a a mindset.

660
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,805
You have to think you have to

661
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,485
to sell ideas such as,

662
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,545
there is no single
version of truth.

663
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:16,905
You you you can
build an environment

664
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,665
that shows
multiple perspectives

665
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:21,865
depending on on
your, your needs.

666
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,180
And and all those source of

667
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,420
truth can coexist
and be linked

668
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,600
together and and
provide answers.

669
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,820
The other thing the other big

670
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,180
idea that that helps,

671
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,735
selling this is to to really

672
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:38,115
build things incrementally.

673
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:41,955
And in a way,

674
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:45,555
redefine the idea
of a quick win

675
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,675
or low hanging
hanging fruits.

676
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,080
It's not about fixing creating

677
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,740
a project that that
answers a problem

678
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,620
immediately or in
the short short term,

679
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,760
but it's about answering real

680
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,015
questions in a way that builds

681
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:08,875
incrementally on
top of a a common

682
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,135
structure. So
the the key aspect

683
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:14,955
of this is to to
build to build

684
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,760
that common data
data structure

685
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,800
that will evolve and Yeah.

686
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,220
I I think evolve into
a knowledge graph.

687
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,280
That that that led into this

688
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,540
notion of
the importance of the,

689
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,120
what they call it,

690
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,705
the knowledge
engineer. Right?

691
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,465
The the the person who helps

692
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:33,105
bridge the gap.

693
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,125
There there while
we are trying to,

694
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:39,745
deliver for business,
there is a big,

695
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,845
huge requirement
for that semantic

696
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:43,285
engineer, knowledge engineer,

697
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,580
to help us get in
that get that way.

698
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,300
I think that was clear theme

699
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,260
that I heard throughout this

700
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,100
conversation. And
you need a mix

701
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,760
of perspectives.

702
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,740
You need, to involve,
the data engineer,

703
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,120
the ontologist, but also,

704
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,525
the business people,
the data science,

705
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:00,965
machine learning,

706
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:06,225
and all of that
having get and,

707
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:08,325
again, working
on incremental,

708
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,545
delivery of solution is a good

709
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:12,910
way to to get
everybody involved

710
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,830
and and develop that shared

711
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,190
understanding. Yeah.

712
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,730
It's a it's
a true collaboration

713
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,150
process. And I'm curious.

714
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,190
I I know we didn't really talk

715
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,790
about this, but
I'm I'm curious

716
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,345
about the process of getting

717
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:27,805
the full ecosystem
to buy in to

718
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,545
the changes that
are going on.

719
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,065
That's been probably part of

720
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,665
the organizational
journey that

721
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,625
we have to pay attention to,

722
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,325
how to make that transition

723
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:38,260
across multiple
departments. Yeah.

724
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,780
That's something
we we said a a

725
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,900
little earlier. No.

726
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,420
I was thinking
it's it's a it's

727
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,620
really a chicken and,

728
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,240
and egg problem because,

729
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,460
in order to show the value,

730
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,800
you need to to build it,

731
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,860
but you don't get
the resources

732
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,480
to build it unless
you show value.

733
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:56,455
So So the the the third topic

734
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,735
that we were talking about was

735
00:25:57,735 --> 00:25:59,175
really about the whole data

736
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:00,295
pipeline itself. Right?

737
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:04,395
There's there's, you know,

738
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:07,035
managing meaning is different

739
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:09,520
than managing processing.

740
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,440
And there are some delusions

741
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,120
that exist in the organization

742
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,260
that we do have to
overcome. Right?

743
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,360
I think there were
some themes about,

744
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,580
you know,

745
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,355
shifting from structuring data

746
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:24,415
to semantic mapping of data,

747
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:27,075
and that was
a a big, concept.

748
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:38,610
Yeah. It is, like I said,

749
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,930
I just said, I I
thought you did

750
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,730
a bit of that,
just before. Yeah.

751
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,810
It's it's really
a a a shift in

752
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,790
mindset that you
you have to and,

753
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:50,655
fortunately, you can find some

754
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:52,035
people in in
your organizations

755
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:53,955
that are already primed to

756
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,375
thinking in terms of concepts

757
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,575
that have been exposed to this

758
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,315
kind of problem.

759
00:26:57,535 --> 00:26:59,555
They can become
bigger advocate

760
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,955
if you if you
find them and and

761
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:03,990
involve them early
because this

762
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,670
solves their their
their problems.

763
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,330
So, like,

764
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,350
master master data
management people,

765
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,350
who have run into those,

766
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,110
those issues of
bottom up versus

767
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,635
top down approaches
of building

768
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:20,775
golden records and and and,

769
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:23,195
ideal models of of data.

770
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,715
This type of
technology can help

771
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:28,635
them go over that that,

772
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:30,695
hurdle that they that they are

773
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:33,300
getting into and and really

774
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,420
create something that will,

775
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,260
that is not just
an ideal exercise of,

776
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,480
conceptualizing a space,

777
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,000
but it's something
very practical

778
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,060
that answer questions.

779
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,345
So weaning ourself off that

780
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:52,385
concept of the single
version of truth,

781
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:55,245
very difficult because we've

782
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:57,165
kind of embedded that into our

783
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,085
mindset coming from core data

784
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:00,765
management. And
now we have kind

785
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,065
of a different objective,

786
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,590
but it's hard to make that

787
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,790
transition in people's
minds. It's hard.

788
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,630
But, again, storytelling
helps there.

789
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,750
You can you can get people to

790
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,130
to come to that understanding

791
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,235
with with very
simple stories.

792
00:28:17,235 --> 00:28:20,295
Like, if you think
of describing

793
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,695
a house, in term
of real estate,

794
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,515
you're going to to use very

795
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:26,355
different
relationships and and

796
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,160
and vocabularies
than if you're

797
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,320
describing it, the same house

798
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,860
in term of, historical,

799
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
historical heritage
or in term of,

800
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,260
I don't know,
industrial zoning.

801
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,625
So having stories like that to

802
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,545
to to demonstrate that you you

803
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:46,005
need multiple perspective,

804
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,525
and it's still
the same house,

805
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:48,905
but you need to look at it in

806
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,465
through different
lens lenses.

807
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:54,465
And having
a a a knowledge graph

808
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:57,550
helps capture all
those lenses,

809
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,470
capture all those decisions

810
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,330
about the rules
around data into

811
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,650
a format that
will that you can

812
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,790
use to answer questions.

813
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,770
This is all about
context. Right?

814
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,405
And I think my I,

815
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:12,125
reflected after our
session, really,

816
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,405
there's only four
things we need

817
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:14,685
for all context. Right?

818
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:20,225
Identity, meaning,
time, and, source.

819
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:22,445
With that, you
can construct any

820
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:23,665
reality that exists,

821
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,450
and that's what is captured in

822
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,090
a knowledge graph.

823
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,690
So weeding ourselves
from these

824
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,050
old concepts are hard,

825
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,830
but the capabilities
of the graph

826
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,490
seem to we gotta
lead us in that

827
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:32,990
direction.

828
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,170
So the final topic on
this section was,

829
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,625
really about governance.
Governance.

830
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,385
Right? And I think there was I

831
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:45,025
guess I heard a big shift in

832
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,485
the way we think
about governance

833
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,285
from our core data management

834
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,745
experiences to our knowledge

835
00:29:51,745 --> 00:29:53,285
graph world. What
did you hear?

836
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,810
Yeah. And, to me,

837
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,670
the the big
takeaway was that,

838
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,370
the knowledge graph is really

839
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,790
the the the embodiment
of all those,

840
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,690
governance decision that,

841
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,330
that you may building a master

842
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,225
data model and and
aligning data,

843
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:14,825
integrating data,

844
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:16,725
instead of having those,

845
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:18,825
those decision be dispersed

846
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,345
throughout the whole
pipeline,

847
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:24,740
you can physically represent

848
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,820
them inside of
a structure that,

849
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,160
at any given time
will tell you

850
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,160
how you're you're
looking at your data.

851
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,900
And when you add
on top of that,

852
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:37,555
data validation
approaches like,

853
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,855
like, Shackle, for example,

854
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:40,295
you can really compare,

855
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,275
what data systems
are providing

856
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,695
you and what you are expecting

857
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:48,935
and detect a much earlier

858
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,410
discontinue disc discrepancies

859
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,050
and and improve data
quality that way.

860
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,270
So before we open it up to see

861
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,470
if there's any questions from

862
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,310
the audience, let me just ask

863
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,985
both of you, you
had to summarize,

864
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,665
you know, kind of the takeaway

865
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:05,965
from these two
sessions we ran.

866
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,605
You know, what was
the big lesson?

867
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,205
What should people
walk away with?

868
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:12,045
What should they
remember about

869
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:12,865
this conversation?

870
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,845
So, Theresa, if you don't mind

871
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:16,180
on the fly, what's,

872
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,380
what are your thoughts about

873
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,400
the kind of the the big
message here?

874
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,860
I think now is the time for

875
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,060
enterprise knowledge graphs.

876
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,500
I think that was
the big takeaway.

877
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,900
It's it's the tech
has been around for,

878
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,980
I would say, over
a decade, right,

879
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,600
in a in a academic setting.

880
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:32,235
And if we, know,

881
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:33,149
the vendor maturity
and the tooling

882
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:33,888
being easier to use,
and it's not,

883
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,155
you know, just for
academics anymore,

884
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,595
it's more enterprise scale.

885
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,895
And then on the other side,

886
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,575
we have the business saying we

887
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,475
need this. This is how we're

888
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:43,215
going to compete.

889
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,390
We're gonna change
how we do it.

890
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,610
So I don't we need
to just bring

891
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,670
those things together.

892
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,010
I think that's our our,

893
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,310
opportunity here.

894
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,490
Warren, what's,

895
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,930
what's what's
the takeaway from

896
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,670
your orientation?

897
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,910
For me, it's,

898
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,545
you don't have to
wait for the ideal

899
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,905
technology to be out there.

900
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:05,265
Start building it.

901
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:06,785
You can start start now

902
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:09,285
incrementally
using, standards,

903
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,625
that decouple the data from

904
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,205
the technology,

905
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:14,965
and you can change
the technology

906
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,990
as long as it follows the same

907
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,390
standards, you
can remove remove

908
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,490
your current platform and and

909
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,330
and apply another one later.

910
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,110
It it should it
shouldn't matter.

911
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,325
So just, just start
start doing it now.

912
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:34,025
Yeah. Alright. So let's see if

913
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,545
there's any questions for,

914
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:36,745
us from the audience.

915
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:38,505
If there are other
questions you

916
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:39,865
wanna ask, these folks,

917
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,160
please just type them in.

918
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,120
I see one kind of looking at

919
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,040
this idea of the difference

920
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,120
between multiple truths and

921
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,340
multiple perspectives,

922
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,740
and I think that's
a real key concept.

923
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
So, Teresa, you know,

924
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,820
how do you see the distinction

925
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,575
between those two things?

926
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,435
Well, I mean, I
think the concepts,

927
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:02,275
like, I used an example
in the chat is,

928
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,635
like, there's Teresa. Right?

929
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:05,315
Let's say what what's what's

930
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,015
Teresa's temperature
right now?

931
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:08,835
And and I think there's both

932
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,455
multiple truths
and perspectives.

933
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:11,940
I usually answer
on the multiple

934
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,460
perspective side
to say there's

935
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,820
there's one truth and it it's

936
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,780
actually what you see,

937
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,540
like a different view
for the different

938
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,660
purpose. But I could see that

939
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,420
if we're actually
gonna have data,

940
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,460
data is measured, right,

941
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,920
or it's data is inputted.

942
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,000
So you could imagine
that one one,

943
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,465
thermometer reads
one thing and

944
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,905
the other thermometer reads

945
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:29,945
another thing. There there's

946
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,465
actually a truth of of what my

947
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:32,605
temperature really is,

948
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,105
but there's these two sources

949
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,505
that gives you
a version and a casting

950
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:38,665
of that first.
So one is the the

951
00:33:38,665 --> 00:33:40,345
source of data and
and the measure

952
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:42,180
that's taken,
and the second is

953
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,800
the perspective
as it's applied.

954
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,620
So so maybe that's
too academic.

955
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,560
I I do see the chat
about, you know,

956
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,060
revenue and things.

957
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,680
But with this information,

958
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,740
now you can make the decision

959
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,215
for how you even,

960
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:58,215
report up to
regulatory. Right?

961
00:33:58,215 --> 00:34:00,055
So we wanna make
the same level

962
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,275
of decisions to say,

963
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:02,715
if we're gonna use
a thermometer,

964
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:04,535
there's the one
that I buy from,

965
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:06,375
the drugstore.
And then the one

966
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,655
that's gone through,
you know,

967
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:10,075
the medical grade
device from the FDA.

968
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,540
And so if I'm making it,

969
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,640
a medical decision
about Teresa,

970
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,300
I better make sure it's using

971
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,900
the thermometer that's been,

972
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,400
medical grade, from the FDA,

973
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,580
not the one she bought from

974
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,240
the drugstore.

975
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,845
So the the definitions about

976
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:26,585
the source of
the data will give

977
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,585
you a way to
actually make sure

978
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:29,865
that your perspective and how

979
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:31,885
you're gonna use it
is is the right one.

980
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,145
So it sounds like it's kind of

981
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:34,585
putting the user
back in control.

982
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,105
Right? So you you
wanna be able

983
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,345
to access the data that is

984
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,900
relevant for your
application.

985
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,420
Is that similar, Lauren,

986
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,460
to what you're you're you're

987
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,900
thinking about? Yeah.

988
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,860
Not only that, but,

989
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,580
it captures
the the the the full

990
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,940
picture. Ideally,

991
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,300
it should capture
the full picture

992
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,055
of all those, assumptions,

993
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:55,875
all those decision
that you've made,

994
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,915
to to to decide
what is the the

995
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:00,035
the right perspective or what

996
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:01,015
is the right temperature.

997
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:05,235
So, it's done in
a way that, two,

998
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:07,095
programs can use to,

999
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,090
not only give you a result,

1000
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,630
but also explain why.

1001
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,850
They can give you
that reasoning of,

1002
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,390
I gave you this temperature

1003
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,810
because it came
from this source

1004
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,090
that was preferred because of

1005
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,930
that reason. And and
you the knowledge

1006
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,770
graph should be able to derive

1007
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,605
that and and provide
that answer.

1008
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:26,345
And if you if you
wanted to ask

1009
00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:27,705
the knowledge
graph everything,

1010
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,565
you would have also
the possibility

1011
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,905
to view
a different perspective

1012
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:33,545
and and make your own
choice. Alright.

1013
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:34,345
So let's close it all.

1014
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:35,625
I just have one question here

1015
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,905
about user interfaces, right,

1016
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:38,345
which I think is
really a question

1017
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,950
about what's
the state of people

1018
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,550
being able to
extract knowledge

1019
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,530
from the graph,

1020
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,930
and has it kept up
with the underlying

1021
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,350
technologies that we're doing

1022
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,390
to develop the graph?

1023
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,150
So, Lauren, what what what's

1024
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,270
your thought? Where where are

1025
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,330
we on user interfaces?

1026
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,535
Where is that headed?

1027
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:55,055
And Theresa will do
the same for you.

1028
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,435
So let's start
with you, Harr.

1029
00:35:57,295 --> 00:36:00,575
The user interface
is one thing

1030
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,895
we discussed in in
in the the other

1031
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,975
panel is you really
need to make

1032
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:09,075
it beautiful, appealing,
easy to use,

1033
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,610
and, engaging. And,

1034
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,130
once one thing I
I I I've seen,

1035
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,090
a lot of time, especially,
by necessity,

1036
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,390
though, the way
things are done

1037
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,070
through more the the academic

1038
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,125
world is that
the user interfaces,

1039
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:25,785
can be can be challenging,

1040
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:26,985
when you look at,

1041
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:28,365
at this kind of technology.

1042
00:36:28,905 --> 00:36:32,045
So, fortunately,

1043
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:34,205
those platforms that
are coming online,

1044
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:36,025
are addressing that.

1045
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:38,010
It's it's becoming easier to

1046
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,630
work with with
the technologies.

1047
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,010
But, that that
should really be

1048
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,250
a big emphasis because
without that,

1049
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,350
it's going to be
very difficult to,

1050
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,550
ideally, you need
something like

1051
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:51,825
an Excel of,

1052
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:54,845
the equivalent not
not the equivalent

1053
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,285
of what Excel was
to to to to to,

1054
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:01,005
spreadsheets. We
need something

1055
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:05,910
as easy to use for
for Use managing,

1056
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,630
yeah, managing,
semantic data.

1057
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,530
So, Teresa, the,

1058
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,030
the state of the customer
experience,

1059
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,190
where where are we headed?

1060
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:17,765
It could certainly be better.

1061
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:21,265
I I I see a lot
of demos that,

1062
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,345
I really don't like where,

1063
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,265
they wanna show me
there's a graph,

1064
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:26,485
and then they say, look.

1065
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,145
Everyone's seen
this demo, like,

1066
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,670
where you could
explode the graph.

1067
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,790
Right? You have
the little node

1068
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,310
and you walk and
you explode it

1069
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,670
and you explode it
and you're like,

1070
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,810
look, now you can
see this this

1071
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,630
this this thought,

1072
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,690
light train of thought.

1073
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,510
Nobody wants to do that.

1074
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,110
I don't want to
do that. Right?

1075
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,790
So I think what
we want to have

1076
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,355
is things that,
interesting thing.

1077
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:45,415
And here's why
it's interesting.

1078
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,600
It actually shows
you the trajectory.

1079
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:46,741
And this is where, again,

1080
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:46,939
if we do go from the consumer

1081
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:47,555
world and where we do use

1082
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,655
knowledge graphs,
let's say Wikipedia.

1083
00:37:49,955 --> 00:37:51,155
Right? And and,

1084
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,110
these are how people
want to see it.

1085
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,550
There's a graph back there.

1086
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,990
Nobody actually sees it,

1087
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,850
but it's it's it's there.

1088
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,590
And so I think it could show

1089
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,410
more explainability.

1090
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,910
And that's actually
what you do

1091
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,350
get from the graph or lineage

1092
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,710
and understanding
which sources

1093
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,445
and which people,
even put things in.

1094
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,805
And that's
the richness that we

1095
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:16,365
should be seeing.

1096
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:19,325
So I think this is
a a, you know,

1097
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:20,765
great place for our vendors to

1098
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,645
actually help, right,

1099
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:23,405
to create these
tools that make

1100
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:25,405
this more user friendly.

1101
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,825
And, again, not
the data scientist,

1102
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,640
not the data engineer, but,

1103
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,520
your business user. Alright.

1104
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,280
So we'll let that
be the last word.

1105
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,240
I almost wanted to,

1106
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,880
thank you both for stepping in

1107
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,660
last minute to help
us summarize.

1108
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,608
It was a terrific experience.

1109
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,628
So, thank you all
very much, and,

1110
00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:46,968
we will call this
session closed.

1111
00:38:47,748 --> 00:38:48,888
Thank you. Thank you.
