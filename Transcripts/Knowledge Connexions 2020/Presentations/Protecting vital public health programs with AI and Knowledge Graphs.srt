1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,180
Welcome to the final
session of

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,440
the morning, before
the lunch break,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,755
with, Vanessa Lopez of IBM

4
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:09,975
Research Ireland.

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,930
Vanessa's research
interests are

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,610
to investigate and envision

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,150
technologies to
better understand

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,370
human needs and support us as

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,630
a society to target complex

10
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:23,345
problems in
the health and social

11
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:25,505
care domain, in
particular using

12
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:26,885
a combination of semantic,

13
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:27,925
natural language,

14
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:29,985
and learning technologies
to capture,

15
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:31,260
integrate, search,

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,620
and query diverse
data and apply

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,000
it to solve real challenges,

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,580
like for integrated care,

19
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,435
to support the care
of the most

20
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:40,575
vulnerable citizens,

21
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,655
and to ultimately obtain,

22
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:43,855
better outcomes.

23
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:46,235
And Vanessa is the,

24
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,575
research scientist
and manager,

25
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,380
within the,

26
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,280
AI for health and
social care,

27
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,640
area of IBM.

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,685
So a a very warm welcome to,

29
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,565
Vanessa and, and over to you.

30
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,105
Hi, everybody.
Thank you so much

31
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,270
for the nice intro.

32
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,110
So, yeah, I am a resource

33
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,530
scientist and
manager for the last

34
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,750
eight years at IBM Research in

35
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,730
the lab in Ireland.

36
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,075
And people here have,

37
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:15,175
lots of different
backgrounds.

38
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,695
Mine is actually academic.

39
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:18,775
I used to be in
the Open University

40
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:21,020
in KMI. But,

41
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,360
since I am in IBM
in our team,

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,600
we have done a lot of work on

43
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,695
applying research
to the integrated

44
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:30,615
health and social
care domain.

45
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,675
So I'm really glad to be here

46
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,195
to share with you
this research

47
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,895
work that we have done jointly

48
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,240
with my team at,

49
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,880
IBM Research Europe
and with IBM

50
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,640
Watson Health. Both teams are

51
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,780
collocated in Dublin,

52
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,260
and we have a mighty
common mission,

53
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:47,525
which is to bring AI to help

54
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,285
transform how the health care

55
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:51,145
systems of the future
will grow.

56
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,280
The group peak
here is obviously

57
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,100
from the old days
where we could

58
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,400
get together in person.

59
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,800
And here, I'll talk,

60
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,120
miss mostly about
my experience

61
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,565
and perspective
perspectives on

62
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,805
using knowledge
graph to address

63
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,565
significant societal problems

64
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,645
in the health care industry in

65
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:11,890
two projects. One that we work

66
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,730
on for almost three years to

67
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,770
combat fraud, waste,

68
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,770
and abuse to protect people

69
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,910
public health problems,

70
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,825
and a second new
or exploratory

71
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,645
one to understand
the impact of

72
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:23,665
social problems
to drive positive

73
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:27,340
health. There are not yet AI

74
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,320
strong offerings in the human

75
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,020
and health services space.

76
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,340
And this is because
while everyone

77
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,355
thinks that this is a real

78
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,495
competitive differentiator,

79
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,375
bringing AI innovations
is really hard.

80
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,100
And embedding AI
requires longer

81
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,940
efforts than classical product

82
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,960
timelines. It
requires validating

83
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,080
what is feasible,

84
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,740
what is the impact of false

85
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,280
negatives and false positive,

86
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,545
understand
the customization effort,

87
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:54,465
and the time to
market to market

88
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,705
assistance. So it
requires a little

89
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:58,225
bit less, and it needs to be

90
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:00,085
driven very much
by the expertise

91
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,480
from the subject
matter experts.

92
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,620
Those are our SMEs.

93
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,860
And our SMEs in particular,

94
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,220
they work with
the government,

95
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:08,965
and they bring experience from

96
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,425
the Medicare and the Medicaid

97
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,265
health programs in the US.

98
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,065
So before I deep dive,

99
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:17,450
one may ask why
Knowledge Graph.

100
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,810
So health care and program

101
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,930
integrity in particular,

102
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,450
they are very complex domains

103
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,450
where science and
AI can really

104
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,270
make a difference.

105
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,325
It has a direct impact
on people's life,

106
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,325
and huge amounts of money are

107
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,225
spent globally.

108
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:34,660
There have been actually lots

109
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,500
of advancements
on the scientific

110
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
community by building
models of disease,

111
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,840
progression, and outcomes.

112
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,615
However, the impact of those

113
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,715
models has been
somehow limited.

114
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,935
Maybe maybe because the models

115
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,955
are silo in
the source of data,

116
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,555
they are silo in the specific

117
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,960
use case or in
a specific disease,

118
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,420
and isolated models provide

119
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,560
isolated predictions.

120
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:01,315
And they do not support very

121
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,575
well
the comprehensive insights

122
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,235
that you need behind complex

123
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,610
decisions and
the best practice

124
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,370
patterns among health care

125
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,690
providers and
payers that remain

126
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,750
hidden in the data.

127
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:16,005
So analyst graph
emerge as a unifying

128
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,165
technology that may facilitate

129
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,085
creating interconnected models

130
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,800
so we get better
at characterizing

131
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,760
and predicting.

132
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,440
Our long term goal
is to empower

133
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
care professionals
with augmented

134
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,725
AI so they can
ultimately improve

135
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:34,365
patient outcomes at
a sustainable cost,

136
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,045
which is a very
ambitious goal.

137
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,905
And this talk is
about our journey

138
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,105
at IBM Research.

139
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,870
And as a spoiler,

140
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,710
we are still far from solving

141
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,690
many of the challenges,

142
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,430
starting with proving how well

143
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,270
it can scale in a real world

144
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,865
environment. So a top priority

145
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,625
by the World
Health Organization

146
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,565
is to reduce disparities on

147
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,440
the delivery of
health care and

148
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,940
to ensure a fair
distribution of funds,

149
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
that there is
enough for everyone

150
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
in need to get
the services that

151
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,820
they are entitled for.

152
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:06,835
Even more at this COVID time

153
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,755
when the needs
are so great and

154
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:09,975
the funding is stretched,

155
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,435
it is key that
the money intended

156
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,055
for vital public
health programs

157
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,310
are not great by intentional

158
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,150
fraud or by unintentionally

159
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,450
providing services that are

160
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,550
unnecessary or they
are inconsistent

161
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,595
with good medical practices or

162
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,735
in the worst case,

163
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,415
even harmful to patients.

164
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,855
So just to make
clear that program

165
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,735
integrity is not about
limiting funding.

166
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,940
It is about making sure that

167
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,320
the money goes where needed.

168
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,940
At to combat fraud, waste,

169
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,720
and abuse is a huge market.

170
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,975
In the US alone,

171
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,635
health care fraud
losses are in

172
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,055
the tens of billions
each year.

173
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,355
These are shocking
amounts because

174
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:51,375
of bus toasters and
bus providers,

175
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,000
and these numbers
indicate a significant

176
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,840
market opportunity.

177
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,920
So in this scenario,

178
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,085
the providers
rendering services

179
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,845
to patient submit claims to

180
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,145
the state health programs,

181
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:05,985
such as Medicare and Medicaid

182
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,505
so they can get reimbursed.

183
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
And the payers know how much

184
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,840
the providers are spending,

185
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,980
but they don't know if this is

186
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,440
in compliance to regulations

187
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,440
which are described in policy

188
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:21,135
or how much is lost
to fraud, waste,

189
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:21,795
and abuse.

190
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,115
So the investigation units,

191
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,220
they validate the integrity of

192
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,420
these claims submitted by

193
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,840
providers so they can recover

194
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,140
overpayments for claims that

195
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,200
infringe policy.

196
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:37,245
This is a labor
intense and an error

197
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,585
prone task. To build a case,

198
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:41,485
the investigators
had to review

199
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,420
the policy, and then they had

200
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,860
to talk to the data analyst to

201
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,320
query the claim data,

202
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
and they go back
and forth till

203
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,760
they find what they need.

204
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,945
They manually encode some

205
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,285
algorithms on top
of the claim data,

206
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:57,165
but most of the stuff
in the policy,

207
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:58,445
it doesn't get automated.

208
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,670
So due to
the overwhelming volume

209
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,210
of policies and claims,

210
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,430
most of the systematic
fraud or

211
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,610
waste is never surfaced.

212
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,485
So the policy is written down

213
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:13,265
in very large text documents

214
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,265
that is describing
what the providers

215
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:16,385
should be doing,

216
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,890
And all information about what

217
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,730
providers are
actually doing is

218
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,590
in the structured claim data.

219
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,315
So state of the art
fraud, waste,

220
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,315
and abuse detection is data

221
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,575
driven on top of
the structured claims,

222
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,635
for example, to
identify providers

223
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:33,015
with anomalous patterns.

224
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,220
But being another
layer does not

225
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,160
always mean a provider
is fraudulent.

226
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,660
And even if so,

227
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,340
it is not enough
to know a provider

228
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,245
is fraudulent. Investigators

229
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,705
need to tie
the clients for this

230
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:46,485
provider to
the policy legislation

231
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,605
to build a case.

232
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:49,345
And these efforts
are not always

233
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,450
successful. The
policy may turn

234
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,450
out to be too vague
to be enforced,

235
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,530
and providers are
confused about

236
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,005
what they should be doing on

237
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,785
the recoverables recoverable

238
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,445
amounts too little to warrant

239
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,045
any action. So we thought it

240
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,645
will be very powerful to bring

241
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,485
this together, and
we are the first

242
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,840
ones to automate
the process of

243
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,920
identifying claims
at risk based

244
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,220
on policy text.

245
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,680
So the unique value lies first

246
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,615
on using NLP and AI
for the automatic

247
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,775
extraction of the actionable

248
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:20,055
knowledge from the policy.

249
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,435
It converts
the policy text into

250
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,815
a knowledge base of benefits

251
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,410
rules that can be
directly applied

252
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,590
to review claims
against policy.

253
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,810
And these human and machine

254
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,905
consumable rules,

255
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:33,525
they provide
a common interpretation

256
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,425
of the policy, which can be

257
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,625
shared across the team and

258
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,320
investigators. And that that

259
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,100
allows a more thorough,
transparent,

260
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,020
and consistent review.

261
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,760
So this benefit benefit rules

262
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,300
that are extracted
from policies,

263
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,855
they are reviewed
by the SMEs,

264
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,315
our subject matter experts,

265
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:54,615
before they execute
the mobile claims.

266
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:55,835
And this is a significant

267
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:58,050
differentiator. It empowers

268
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,590
the investigators to size and

269
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,890
prioritize the investigations

270
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,770
they may follow based
on the evidence

271
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,450
and on the likelihood
of recovery

272
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,305
from funds and as
well on the policy

273
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:11,605
by executing those
policy rules

274
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:12,585
on top of the claims.

275
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:13,925
And a second big piece is

276
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:16,810
explainability.
Each label claim

277
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,970
at risk is linked
to the benefit

278
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,630
rule alongside the natural

279
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,230
language part from the policy

280
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,810
text that explains
what is the violation

281
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,595
. So there are many challenges

282
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:29,595
behind automating the claim

283
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,915
processing from
policy at the scale.

284
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,010
And a core challenge
is to capture

285
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,630
the knowledge
from the text and

286
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,850
to model the domain.

287
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,095
So at the center,
there is an ontology,

288
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,555
which is an evolving
asset that

289
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:46,495
we created manually with our

290
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,680
experts to bring
to bridge this

291
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
conceptualization gap on how

292
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,300
the experts think
about the policy

293
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,340
and how the data is
storing the claims.

294
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,740
The ontology captures
the terminology,

295
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,965
and it makes explicit complex

296
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,105
relations that we
are interested on,

297
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:04,405
so it guides destruction.

298
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,610
Another challenge is that we

299
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,290
didn't have any label data to

300
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,790
start with. So an important

301
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,930
achievement was engagement and

302
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,550
the validation with the users

303
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,830
early in the development.

304
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,465
So we build basic UI tools to

305
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,305
interact and gather
feedback and

306
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:23,925
ground truth data
from the experts

307
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,485
and to learn from
that human feedback.

308
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,970
Lastly, we need to
connect the policy

309
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,250
information to the structured

310
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,090
claim data in order to reason

311
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,550
over claims, to quantify,

312
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,910
and explain the violations.

313
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,035
So, overall, this is a new way

314
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:39,875
that we are
proposing to consume

315
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,855
rules from policy.

316
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:43,110
And to do so, we have to work

317
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,450
very closely with our
policy as person.

318
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,270
What are the type
of rules most

319
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,030
suitable and of high value?

320
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,470
And this is just here a simple

321
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,045
example from
a dental policy on

322
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:54,485
a service limitation type of

323
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,965
rule on the number
of units a provider

324
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:59,365
can bill for
a given service on

325
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,545
a given patient over
a period of times.

326
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,080
So there are many ways ways in

327
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
which the policy
text may describe

328
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,740
this criteria,

329
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,220
but with the with the same

330
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,580
underlying semantics.

331
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:13,695
So after ingesting
the PDF policy,

332
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:16,175
the second step is
to automatically

333
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:17,995
identify the concepts and

334
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,355
relations that are expressing

335
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:21,380
the sentence and to abstract

336
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,320
that into common
reusable patterns

337
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,180
or structure
templates of benefits

338
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,960
rules as they are
modeling the ontology,

339
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,040
like capturing for
which services,

340
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:32,245
whether they
qualify in eligible

341
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,865
members, whether the limits,

342
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,785
are there any
other requirements

343
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:36,745
or exclusions.

344
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,410
A knowledge graph is then

345
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,230
automatically populated with

346
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,690
this knowledge funded policy.

347
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,635
And because
automatic knowledge

348
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:50,135
extraction is really
far from perfect,

349
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:53,335
human AI collaboration
is crucial

350
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,690
for experts to
review and validate

351
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,430
the strategic rules.

352
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,570
Once that's done,

353
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,190
the last step
connects the policy

354
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,810
information to the structured

355
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,575
claim data.

356
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,235
This is a mapping
and configurable

357
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,375
step that maps conditions and

358
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,695
values from the ontology to

359
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:13,315
column values on the claims.

360
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,410
So it can execute on top of

361
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,650
claims and label
the claims that

362
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,650
are valid or at risk depending

363
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,790
on the type of rule.

364
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:24,155
So this is just
to impress with

365
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,595
some boxes, but no worries.

366
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,755
I won't go into detail. Yes.

367
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:29,355
To give a flavor
here that there

368
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:32,010
are lots of moving
parts behind

369
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,250
an AI system. And these are

370
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,930
components that
we build on top

371
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,990
of existing technology,

372
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,390
which combines NLP,

373
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:42,105
Now let's reason
in so we cannot

374
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:44,125
put the knowledge
base of benefits

375
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,025
rules from the policy and that

376
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:47,245
the users can review.

377
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:49,550
And from them, we we can learn

378
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,310
from that feedback
based on deep

379
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,210
learning approaches.

380
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,850
So the instruction
improves over time.

381
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,445
Here, as a sample
on the knowledge

382
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,385
extraction, this is built on

383
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,625
complementary different
technologies,

384
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:07,600
assistant to perform
various NLP tasks,

385
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,980
like post tagging,

386
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,580
ontology based annotations,

387
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,220
and to strat
functional dependencies

388
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,545
in text. We you
we do that based

389
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,325
on semantic role
labeling functionality,

390
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,005
like what is the action,

391
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,345
who is the agent,

392
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:21,565
the theme of the context,

393
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:23,565
and also dependency trees.

394
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,820
These are very
useful representations

395
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,560
for relation
extraction as they

396
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,340
collect entities in a sentence

397
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,655
through label edges.

398
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,635
In some, different strategies

399
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,455
are used to extract those

400
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,215
potentially relevant
textual pot

401
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,700
patterns and expose predicate

402
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,640
argument structures
from the sentence.

403
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,580
And from those,

404
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
we build a semantic
graph based

405
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,425
not just of concurrency of

406
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,465
entities in the sentence,

407
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,165
but how the terms
are linguistically

408
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,845
and semantically connected.

409
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:55,200
So all domain information is

410
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,100
inside ontology,

411
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,760
and this is a a sample
of the subset

412
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,805
of the ontology
that represents

413
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:03,865
the scheme of
the rule described

414
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,025
in the sample, which is meant

415
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:08,345
to model a maximum reimburse

416
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,620
amount for a service
for certain

417
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,640
members during
a certain period.

418
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,640
And OA is flexible.

419
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,345
It does not impose
a fixed template,

420
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:18,865
but the main
constraints can be

421
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:20,725
defined to ensure semantically

422
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,245
meaningful benefit rules.

423
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:23,185
Like, for example,

424
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:25,445
this joint constraint
that tells

425
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,930
that a service cannot be both

426
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,090
a cover applicable service and

427
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,090
an excluded service
in the same

428
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,150
benefit rule.

429
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,135
So the goal is to
populate the ontology

430
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,975
with a knowledge graph with

431
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,755
the benefit rules, if any,

432
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:43,235
extracted from the text.

433
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,150
So after matching at the level

434
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,810
of entities to
classes, instances,

435
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,970
properties, or data types,

436
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,950
the system search for matches

437
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,225
at the level of patterns,

438
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,225
transforming the text all

439
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:57,225
dependencies into
graph patterns

440
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:58,365
in a knowledge graph.

441
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,965
By reasoning over
the anthology,

442
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:02,890
it can infer
implicit relations

443
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,810
and a path connecting
the entities.

444
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,470
And this is a simple example

445
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,730
where we have
thousand dollars,

446
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,050
which is annotated as
a monetary amount,

447
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,125
and up to, which
matches an ontological

448
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,505
property, which expected range

449
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:17,725
is monetary amount.

450
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:18,925
So they are linguistically

451
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,445
connected in the sentence,

452
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,650
and we can also
find a path that

453
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,250
semantically connects them to

454
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,630
build a knowledge graph.

455
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,950
So that's the idea
behind. Right?

456
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,375
And the results is an olive

457
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,075
graph that in all information

458
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:34,075
needed for these benefit rules

459
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:35,995
attached to this sentence.

460
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,880
Now the goal is not
just a distraction,

461
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,420
but to empower
the investigators

462
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,560
to interact with the tool and

463
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,420
to build trust in the AI.

464
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:46,495
So we needed to
hide the complexity

465
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,235
behind this
knowledge graph and

466
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,755
present an unambiguous flat

467
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:51,935
representation of
a benefit rule.

468
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,480
And on top of those,

469
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,020
that user friendly
representation,

470
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,660
the user can correct
any errors.

471
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,100
And through these
validations,

472
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,180
they are
incrementally building

473
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,225
institutionally institutional

474
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,985
knowledge based
on policy rules

475
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,445
that we can also
use as a ground

476
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,090
truth for evaluation purposes

477
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,790
on one hand. So
we can evaluate

478
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,530
in terms of
precision and recall

479
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,310
and publish results
in conferences.

480
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:17,195
But, also,

481
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,535
as we work with
SMEs and as this

482
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,075
shared knowledge
base is created,

483
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,515
the question becomes,

484
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,735
how can we learn
from this human

485
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,980
feedback to predict benefit

486
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,460
rules in
a nondeterministic way?

487
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,240
So we use the ground
truth data

488
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,715
to fine tune transfer language

489
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,235
models such as PERT.

490
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,215
Now learning from
a small grown

491
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,075
small ground truth
data is challenging,

492
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,200
so we combine knowledge graph

493
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,820
with this deep
learning approaches,

494
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,540
enhanced with
semantic embeddings

495
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,800
with two goals.

496
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,105
One is classifying
with greater

497
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:53,345
accuracy the sections
in the policy

498
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,945
that are most likely relevant

499
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:57,025
with the benefit rule and also

500
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,525
to predict the spans
in a benefit rule.

501
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,940
So to be able to
annotate unseen

502
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,100
mentions of entities
and relations

503
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,920
and to annotate them directly

504
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,220
with relevant relation.

505
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,745
So it is not just
saying that,

506
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,825
let's say, an oral evaluation

507
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,985
in the sample is a service,

508
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:15,565
but to say that in the context

509
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:18,230
of this sentence,
it has two roles.

510
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,010
It can be
an applicable service

511
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,490
payable once every
three years,

512
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,250
or it can be a nonreimbursable

513
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,455
service if given at the same

514
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,555
date and other
listed reimbursable

515
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,395
services. So you
can see here,

516
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,715
the structure is
quite complex.

517
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,850
So it is the learning.

518
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,050
So this is work in progress,

519
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,910
but we are getting
preliminary,

520
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,750
potentially good results.

521
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,165
So now to combat
fraud, waste,

522
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:45,505
and abuse is a huge market,

523
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,785
and it is hard for
humans to scale.

524
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,180
But machines can do it if we

525
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,700
capture the right
knowledge and

526
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,400
the sophistication
in the models.

527
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,940
So to prove
the feasibility and

528
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,160
validate the results,

529
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,045
we build call to
standards with

530
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:00,865
our investigators.

531
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,245
They manually
select it and hand

532
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:05,505
coded a set of
twenty representative

533
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:08,210
algorithms that correspond to

534
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,830
some of our policy rules.

535
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,890
It is a very
limited set for now

536
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,590
because encoding its algorithm

537
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:15,305
to build the voltage
standard,

538
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,005
it takes
precious investigations

539
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:18,845
investigators' time.

540
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,465
As for those, the system can

541
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:23,165
automatically take
the validated

542
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,370
rules to label
claims and quantify

543
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,770
funds at risk with
the same accuracy,

544
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,750
same precision recall of our

545
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,730
SMEs on top of a hundred
million claims.

546
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,655
And this validates
the semantics

547
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:36,635
behind the model.

548
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:37,675
See, for example,

549
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,835
rule seven on the table,

550
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,310
it has a relatively
small number

551
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,530
of claims at risk,

552
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,190
but they accounted for very

553
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,270
large amounts of
money and funds

554
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,410
potentially recoverable.

555
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:52,405
In fact, out of
a hundred million

556
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:55,125
claims, we can identify almost

557
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,625
five hundred thousand
claims at risk.

558
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,670
That is point
zero five percent

559
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,150
of the claims for a total of

560
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,770
twenty nine million value.

561
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,470
This is pulling needles out of

562
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,615
a haystack. This twenty nine

563
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,615
million is from a small set of

564
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:13,115
rules selected for
evaluation purposes,

565
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,210
but we have hundreds
of policies

566
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,610
containing hundreds of rules

567
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,630
across areas like
physical therapy,

568
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,830
medical equipment,

569
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,390
behavioral and mental
health, vaccines,

570
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,935
you name it. So the good thing

571
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:27,715
is that the execution
of claims

572
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,555
is configurable
and transferable.

573
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,735
So there is no need
to write a unique

574
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,755
algorithm to cover each rule.

575
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,560
Given the same
claims as schema,

576
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,580
the rule is executed
on the same

577
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,260
way across benefit rules.

578
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,800
And that's another
advantage. Yes.

579
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,325
So the investigators
can approach

580
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,185
investigation from
multiple angles.

581
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:48,785
They can search the policy,

582
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,405
relating to suspiciously high

583
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,740
bill services,
and they can see

584
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,100
the payment rules
that have been

585
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,200
extracted on what
policy says.

586
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,860
And they can review them and

587
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,240
publish them into a dashboard

588
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,935
to immediately
visual visualize

589
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,935
how the data looks like based

590
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:06,375
on those rules and the impact

591
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,975
in terms of invalid claims and

592
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:08,875
amount of money.

593
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,900
And underneath all
that, the ontology,

594
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,200
what it does, it
provides a shared

595
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,280
interpretation of
the policy and

596
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,560
makes this process of rule

597
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,105
creation more transparent and

598
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,365
comprehensible for
machine and humans.

599
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:22,965
This increases
the productivity,

600
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:26,865
basically. It also
provides an abstraction

601
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,660
that allow us to reuse what we

602
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,180
learn in one place
to somewhere

603
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,640
else and minimizes
the gap between

604
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,865
the policy intent with inter

605
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:37,625
protection interpretation and

606
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,705
the execution, which increase

607
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,305
the confidence
in the rules and

608
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:43,390
the consistency of how
they are playing.

609
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,950
So we are aiming
to capture more

610
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,470
and more diverse
rules over time

611
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,150
and to interpret more complex

612
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,590
requirements,
like if a service

613
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,530
was medical
medically necessary

614
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,505
that requires linking health

615
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:55,865
records to claims.

616
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:57,385
And there are
many opportunities

617
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:58,965
to apply this technology in

618
00:20:58,965 --> 00:20:59,705
other scenarios,

619
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,085
perhaps to assist pro assist

620
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:03,750
providers to know
what they need

621
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,830
to attach to claims before

622
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,510
submission so they don't get

623
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,950
rejected by the payers because

624
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,825
of missing information or to

625
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,905
identify gaps in policy so we

626
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,125
can improve the communication

627
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,725
between payers and providers.

628
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,090
And now let me
just briefly move

629
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,170
to other cool exploratory work

630
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,090
in progress. This is on using

631
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,630
knowledge graph
as a foundation

632
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,610
for understanding
the impact of

633
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,275
social determinants of class.

634
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:30,275
This is a use
case example that

635
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,195
we published very recently on

636
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,795
exploring social drivers of

637
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,360
health during COVID
by leveraging

638
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,000
knowledge graph and
population trends.

639
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,800
But first, what are
social determinants?

640
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,075
So those are all
the things that

641
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,855
are in the fringe
of the traditional

642
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:47,055
health care system,

643
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:48,955
but that have
a major influence

644
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:51,600
on health and are
hugely important

645
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,140
to determine
the treatments with

646
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,120
successful outcomes.

647
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,600
Take, for example,
homeless of poverty.

648
00:21:58,675 --> 00:21:59,875
So they have an impact on

649
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,455
admissions to hospital
and the complications

650
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:05,015
of a disease and
are often a hidden

651
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:07,335
driver of cost
behind vulnerable

652
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:08,990
population. There are many

653
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,210
examples in the news.

654
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,610
Here is million
dollar married.

655
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,150
He was a homeless
alcoholic man

656
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,445
in Nevada. And for ten years,

657
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:18,885
he was on the streets,

658
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:21,665
and he ran a medical
bill larger

659
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:22,965
than anyone in Nevada.

660
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,560
And it is one of
the samples why

661
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,580
social problems may be cheaper

662
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,860
to solve than to ignore.

663
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It costs one
million dollars not

664
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,540
to do something
about malware.

665
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:35,815
And despite research showing

666
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:37,175
this strong link between

667
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:38,715
understanding
social determinants

668
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:39,995
and health outcomes,

669
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,210
there is a gap in
the market for

670
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,570
orphanings that work with

671
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,410
unstructured tests and that

672
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,510
cover social
determinants of health.

673
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,075
Our goal, not there yet,

674
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:52,355
but in the past too,

675
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:54,435
is to bring understanding and

676
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:56,455
evidence on what is the impact

677
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:58,880
of tackling social aspects to

678
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
improve health outcomes and to

679
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,780
reduce the cost on
populations at risk.

680
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,580
Now when when we
think about COVID,

681
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,500
we first think
about the disease,

682
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,965
the symptoms, how it spread,

683
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,785
how to cure it,

684
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,805
or even the global
economic crisis.

685
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:17,200
But there are also significant

686
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,880
societal consequences.

687
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,660
COVID basically
escalates the need

688
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,040
of the vulnerable
populations,

689
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,355
and the social
problems are made

690
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:26,655
worse because of it.

691
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,235
So what we are looking at here

692
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:30,955
is perhaps the less
study social

693
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:32,495
and other health concerns

694
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,040
surrounding the pandemic.

695
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,960
Take food insecurity.

696
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,620
You may think of,

697
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,500
several areas
where people have

698
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,040
not access to food,

699
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:43,915
or you have you have a Spanish

700
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,115
mama that will tell you about

701
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,375
children in Africa
at every meal time.

702
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:50,230
But in the US, food insecurity

703
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,990
is also a big issue.

704
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,170
People that may live in food

705
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,930
deserts where they only have

706
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,835
access to McDonald's
and fresh,

707
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:01,615
healthy, real food
is unaffordable

708
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:04,095
for them. So our contribution

709
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,640
in this paper was
to build a proof

710
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,740
of concept where we monitor

711
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,720
concerning trends in social

712
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
determinants that are arising

713
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,840
from COVID and link them to

714
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,600
other potential
health and social

715
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,225
issues to identify
those populations

716
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,705
that are vulnerable
or that are

717
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:22,405
at risk of becoming vulnerable

718
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:23,765
during the pandemic.

719
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,540
Now differently from clinical

720
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,700
data where we have
many standards

721
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,360
and terminology,

722
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,220
there is not yet
a taxonomy for

723
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,775
social determinants
of health,

724
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,715
but there is
an ongoing processes.

725
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:37,855
It is really a big
effort because

726
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:39,475
the domain is really broad.

727
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,270
So for this purpose,

728
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,910
for evidence
discovery relation

729
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,810
evidence discovery,

730
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,590
we structured
associations from

731
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,815
PubMed between
social and clinical

732
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:53,275
terms, and we mined those

733
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,055
relations into
a knowledge graph.

734
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:56,575
To start with,

735
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,670
we look at
the social determinants

736
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,410
that were trending high and

737
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,650
which ones are trending higher

738
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,385
when COVID. In particular,

739
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:06,385
we look at Google
Trends to get

740
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:08,145
a glimpse of
the social concerns

741
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:10,005
on people's mind
during COVID.

742
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,650
We found trends like jobless,

743
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,570
food insecurity,
and shortage,

744
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,550
which coincides
with the lockdown

745
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,330
and thus hardly surprising.

746
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,410
So in a second step,

747
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:22,415
we look at for those social

748
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:23,455
trends of interest,

749
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,475
like food insecurity
in scientific

750
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,295
literature, particularly in

751
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:28,115
PubMed abstract,

752
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,890
to mine the evidence that they

753
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,350
could affect people's health.

754
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,490
So we tag the text in this

755
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,850
abstract with a tool called

756
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,690
MetaMap to highlight concepts

757
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,990
clinical concepts.

758
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:40,855
And once we have
those sentences

759
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,855
containing both
food insecurity

760
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:45,075
and other clinical or social

761
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:45,975
related issue,

762
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,950
we use a birth
based classifier

763
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,090
to annotate the sentence as is

764
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,590
it it has
a positive association

765
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,830
or a negative one
or no correlation

766
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,655
or something more complex.

767
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:58,755
So for example,

768
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:00,455
food insecurity is positively

769
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:03,075
associated with h b a one c.

770
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,370
That is one of the markets
for diabetes.

771
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,510
So we capture those
into a knowledge

772
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,450
graph to build our
first catalog.

773
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,270
And this is this is a graph

774
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,710
between food insecurity and

775
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,515
unemployment with the most

776
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:16,535
relevant neighbors,
like anxiety,

777
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:18,215
obesity, depression,

778
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:20,135
and a bit of noise too.

779
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,275
So we verify some
of these terms

780
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:23,920
like obesity and coping,

781
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,660
and we also find higher trends

782
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,540
in Google Earth,

783
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,380
which show that we are able to

784
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,140
capture relevant
relations between

785
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,440
the social and the health.

786
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:34,235
Now, current and
future work is

787
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:35,755
to keep improving
this relation

788
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,355
identification to catch more

789
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:39,670
complex relations
and not ratios

790
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,750
so we can assign
weight to the ages.

791
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,890
And the value of
this knowledge

792
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,545
graph is, in fact,

793
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:47,325
to bring it together
with clinical

794
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:49,245
records or population records

795
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,465
to create foundations for new

796
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,385
analytic offerings
offerings and

797
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:55,325
to be able to do
further research

798
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,740
as to quantify the impact of

799
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,980
these relations in clinical

800
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,620
outcomes and to
improve current

801
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,225
test risk models
and identify,

802
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:05,725
for example, what kind of

803
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,405
interventions we
could have for

804
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:08,685
those high cost high needs

805
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:09,905
segments of the population.

806
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,040
In my experience,

807
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,260
using ontologies and
knowledge graph,

808
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
they help us really to develop

809
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,100
technologies that are able to

810
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,800
work with an open
set of features

811
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:22,395
and that they can
be reused and

812
00:27:22,395 --> 00:27:24,315
they can scale to broad domain

813
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,575
knowledge such as including

814
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:28,075
health records, claims,

815
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:30,320
social determinants,
and so on.

816
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,000
So we can build
models that are

817
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
more human understandable and

818
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,380
machine consumable.

819
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,200
And just to finish,

820
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I hope I convinced you that

821
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,465
health care is one of those

822
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:42,225
areas where AI
and knowledge can

823
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,905
really have major impact and

824
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,105
that there are lots of open

825
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,285
challenges to keep
researchers happy.

826
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,350
But it is in particular time

827
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,650
that we had
a conversation about

828
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,530
what real benefits users final

829
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,230
users get from the AI systems

830
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,355
and to start designing system

831
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,435
for the users rather
than assuming

832
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:03,595
that a high accuracy
is sufficient

833
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:05,435
for them. We need
to define and

834
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,335
measure impact,

835
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,130
and that requires finding this

836
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,650
wow moment where you are able

837
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,570
to go to a user
and tell the story

838
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,810
so you engage them
since the early

839
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,475
stages. In my view,

840
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:17,535
there are many benefits,

841
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,815
at least in this domain.

842
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:19,935
Like, for example,

843
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:21,775
care professionals turnover

844
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,295
turnover is high,

845
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,930
knowledgeable experts are in

846
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,930
short supply, and
there is a need

847
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,250
to share and scale
expertise for

848
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,270
which knowledge
is a good tool.

849
00:28:31,855 --> 00:28:33,615
There is also an aspiration to

850
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:35,475
support the experts
with explainable

851
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,855
and concise concise
evidence on

852
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,935
the point of care to back up

853
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:40,675
their decisions.

854
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,860
Like, whatever it
is recommending

855
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,560
interventions or whatever is

856
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,400
identifying ways or improving

857
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,840
policy to reduce health care

858
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,005
disparities. Like,
for example,

859
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:54,085
you can give fifty blood text

860
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:55,685
analysis to someone per year,

861
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:57,045
but that won't
make a difference

862
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,110
in any outcome.

863
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,050
And the evidence is
there in the data.

864
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,250
But in some, it is not much

865
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,650
about what technology
is underneath,

866
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:07,705
but about empowering
the health

867
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,885
care agencies and
the governments

868
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:12,345
to reboot society
with a better

869
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:14,260
way to approach
health care and

870
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,580
a more adaptive
post COVID health

871
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,100
system. And that's the end of

872
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,920
my presentation.

873
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,560
I think, there's
some questions

874
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,840
coming through at the moment.

875
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,435
I can see, a couple
of people typing.

876
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:30,515
I'll just read
the first one out.

877
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,835
It appears you use OWL,

878
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:35,710
and you have complex
and explicit

879
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,110
SME rules. Question,

880
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,590
are you using OWL DL?

881
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,390
Which rules engine
do you use?

882
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,755
How do you translate rules

883
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:48,055
implicit in the ontology to

884
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:50,055
those you run against
the knowledge

885
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:53,020
graph? Question
from people. Yeah.

886
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,820
Yeah. That that is,

887
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,340
that is a very good question.

888
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,640
I didn't cover that.

889
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,320
And, yes, we are
using actually all,

890
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:02,135
behind, so that's how we are

891
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,195
defining the ontology.

892
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:07,115
But then what we
do is transform

893
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:10,560
this knowledge
graph into a flat

894
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
representation that we store

895
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,120
actually in a post
in a Mongo,

896
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,180
sorry, in a MongoDB.

897
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:18,355
And it's
a simple representation

898
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,175
where you show just
the conditions

899
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:22,195
and the values
so that the SMEs

900
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:23,875
can in a very easy way,

901
00:30:24,735 --> 00:30:26,560
with their own
terminology that

902
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,100
we actually define
in ontology,

903
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,300
curate those those rules.

904
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,760
And then what happened is is

905
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,745
these conditions
and these values,

906
00:30:35,745 --> 00:30:38,885
they are mapped
for to claims,

907
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:42,650
columns and to claims
values. Right?

908
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,010
So and this is happening in

909
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,970
odontology as well.

910
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,810
That's domain
knowledge that we

911
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,970
live in odontology
saying, for example,

912
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,185
that the service about topical

913
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,965
fluoride describing the policy

914
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,585
corresponds to codes zero zero

915
00:30:55,585 --> 00:30:57,665
one and codes zero zero two as

916
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:58,965
they are billed
on the claims.

917
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,920
So those that
linkage information

918
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,600
is behind the syntactology,

919
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,480
and we use that to basically

920
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,480
send a set of queries.

921
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:10,275
So we aggregate the claims.

922
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:13,155
We filter claims
based on the service

923
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,395
or based on
the period of time.

924
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:17,295
We apply some
operators like you

925
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,090
have to be between this h and

926
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,470
this h and so on.

927
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,710
So then that executes,

928
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,290
and the selected claims,

929
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,890
they are marked as valid or as

930
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,755
invalid depending on
the type of rule.

931
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,855
So it's it's
a deterministic approach.

932
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,695
What we are now investigating

933
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:35,790
as well is to be to
use a probabilistic

934
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,310
reasoning engine.

935
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,730
So to be able to execute that

936
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,235
knowledge even in the cases

937
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,615
where maybe we are not fully

938
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:47,355
sure or fully confident
on the rule.

939
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:48,855
So there may be rules that we

940
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:50,215
have a very high
confidence that

941
00:31:50,215 --> 00:31:51,450
they are accurate because they

942
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,110
were validated with
by the users,

943
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,370
all the stuff are not.

944
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,130
So a probabilistic engine will

945
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,825
be a good tool to to
handle those cases,

946
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:01,185
but that's that's
currently work

947
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,665
in progress. So
integrating a rule

948
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:05,505
engine is is work
in progress,

949
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:07,445
and we'll see what
results we get.

950
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Cool. Interesting.
Thanks for that.

951
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,320
Whilst there's
a couple of people

952
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,515
typing questions,
Keith says thank you,

953
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,495
just whilst that's happening,

954
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,795
one of the questions
that came up in,

955
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:27,360
some of the workshop
shop sessions

956
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
was around I don't
know whether

957
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,740
you you may be able
to answer this is,

958
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,000
if someone was
starting to look

959
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,935
at open source
biomedical ontologies,

960
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:39,335
I guess, what
common ontologies

961
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:40,935
there are that you
would recommend

962
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,690
working with? Yeah.

963
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:49,290
So we have, work
a lot with ICD ten.

964
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:53,225
It's a very medical medical

965
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:55,385
terminology for, you
know, all these,

966
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:57,920
like, symptoms,
diagnosis, and so on.

967
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,580
We work a lot as
well with UMLS,

968
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,360
which is a unifying medical

969
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,965
language terminology
that gives

970
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:07,185
you also a lot of information

971
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:08,785
about health care services,

972
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:11,425
a lot of information
about diagnosis.

973
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:12,625
Like, for example,

974
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:15,480
you are a high risk of cancer

975
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,400
or highest risk of
something else,

976
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,920
information about
treatments and so on.

977
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,920
There are also ontologies for

978
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,315
procedure codes
as they are bill

979
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:27,175
on the provider claims.

980
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,155
And those are the ones that we

981
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:32,360
are mostly working
on, but, is,

982
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,580
yeah, it's it's
great to see all

983
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,860
these anthologies that are

984
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,620
appearing there
every every day,

985
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,240
basically. There
are more and more.

986
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,785
Cool. Thanks, Vanessa.

987
00:33:44,845 --> 00:33:45,825
That's really helpful.

988
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,925
So we'll just give
it a second.

989
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:53,390
I can see Douglas
Moore is typing.

990
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,990
So just to see if we can make

991
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,075
for his questions
to come through.

992
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:00,535
And then if that
doesn't come through,

993
00:34:00,835 --> 00:34:03,655
then, we'll probably
break for lunch.

994
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,315
Of course, any anyone that has

995
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:08,620
any follow-up
questions, please do,

996
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,560
link up with Vanessa on the on

997
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,440
the Slack channel.

998
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,165
You can you can
ask them there.

999
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:18,245
Here we are. Couple
of questions.

1000
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:20,825
So was the claims processing,

1001
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,530
a point solution for
validating claims,

1002
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,310
or has the effort
to map source

1003
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,850
data to greater benefits?

1004
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:37,605
Not sure if So it seems to be

1005
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:40,425
a question about
the claim processing.

1006
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,590
I'm not so sure
if I'm not gonna

1007
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,130
answer this question
correctly.

1008
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,585
But, so the claim
processing is

1009
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,445
something that is happening

1010
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,365
already on the state
of the art,

1011
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:57,065
and in particular
for fraud, waste,

1012
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:59,550
and abuse detection
approaches.

1013
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,830
Right? They look at outliers.

1014
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,130
They look at
calculating the risk

1015
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,725
of providers and so on.

1016
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:09,765
So the claim data
is usually in

1017
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,545
a very well
structured format.

1018
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:14,085
Right? And in some cases,

1019
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,925
it's also linked with health

1020
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:18,230
records that give you
extra information.

1021
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,150
Like, you can look at the care

1022
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,230
pathway of a person,
the outcomes,

1023
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,130
and so on.

1024
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,465
What we try to
do here is a bit

1025
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,845
different because we want to

1026
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:31,245
understand the claims,

1027
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,725
not by looking only
at the claim data,

1028
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,805
but by understanding
the policy.

1029
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,850
If the policy
says you can't do

1030
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,470
this and you cannot do that,

1031
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,250
and then to see
if we can execute

1032
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,850
that on the claim
of data to see

1033
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,315
actually what
claims they don't

1034
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:46,535
seem to be doing that.

1035
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:49,155
So that gives you
an indication

1036
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:51,095
to the investigator
to have a look

1037
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:52,995
and to explore more
and to create.

1038
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,515
If that is the case that they

1039
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:57,930
are really,
infringing policy,

1040
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,530
they can build a case.

1041
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,270
And in order to build a case,

1042
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,410
they had to tell.

1043
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:04,405
This is a policy
lay legislation

1044
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:05,925
that these claims
are breaking.

1045
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,225
I'm not sure if
I answered that

1046
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:13,970
question well. Yeah.

1047
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,630
I think, I I think that that,

1048
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,525
answered that.
And then there's

1049
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:21,065
another comment,

1050
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:24,825
from Frederick
Frederick, Landquist,

1051
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:30,530
using mesh UMLS
ICD, etcetera,

1052
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,490
medical vocabularies.

1053
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,730
But have you also created one

1054
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,195
context specific
for the speaking

1055
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,535
about the domain
and mapped this

1056
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,235
with the other large
vocabularies?

1057
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
Yeah. Yeah. That's correct.

1058
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,680
That's the case.

1059
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,620
So we actually
created an ontology

1060
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,125
manually with
the domain as per us.

1061
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,645
So we can this
ontology is the the

1062
00:36:57,645 --> 00:36:59,165
one that is guiding
the knowledge

1063
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:01,960
extraction, and it's basically

1064
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,980
focusing on things
that are actionable.

1065
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,040
So I care about these entities

1066
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,320
and these relations because

1067
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,055
these are the things
that I can

1068
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:11,215
then go to the claim data and

1069
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:13,715
see if something is
compliant or not.

1070
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:15,775
So that ontology
was direct was

1071
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,075
created within that schema.

1072
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,010
And then, however,

1073
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,770
there is a lot of
instance data.

1074
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,810
And for that, we
use other sources.

1075
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,655
There is a lot of
tabular tabular data.

1076
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,255
For example, it thinks about

1077
00:37:28,255 --> 00:37:30,835
describing places
of service. Right?

1078
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,975
You can give this service in

1079
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:34,275
the of in the hospital,

1080
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,095
or you can give
this service in

1081
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:36,850
this condition.

1082
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,290
So all those codes
and all those

1083
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,190
sources, we list them
into the ontology,

1084
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,410
just by creating some mappings

1085
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,870
as in as in fancy.

1086
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:47,545
And we also, through
the ontology,

1087
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,145
links to those other
terminologies.

1088
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:50,405
So for example,

1089
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:51,545
there may be an eligibility

1090
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:53,065
criteria that says,

1091
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,400
in order for you
to get topical

1092
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
fluoride, you
need to be a high

1093
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,580
risk of caries or cavities.

1094
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,705
So to extract this
high risk of caries,

1095
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,085
we use UMLS. We
say that we are

1096
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,685
expecting something there that

1097
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:10,380
may be a medical
diagnosis. Right?

1098
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,920
And then that is the domain of

1099
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,360
that property, and that's some

1100
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,820
part of the eligibility
criteria.

1101
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:18,005
So this is how we
do the linking

1102
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:18,905
to UMLS.

1103
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:20,885
It's based also it's based

1104
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:22,265
basically on the semantic

1105
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:24,345
hierarchy that UMLS has.

1106
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,510
Perfect. Great.

1107
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,270
Thanks, thanks so
much for that,

1108
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,670
Vanessa.

1109
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,350
Really fantastic talk.

1110
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:35,451
Thanks to you, and
enjoy your lunch.

1111
00:38:36,711 --> 00:38:38,651
You too. Thanks. Bye.
