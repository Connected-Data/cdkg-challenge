1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,340
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,580
I'm very happy to
be with you today.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,220
So I'm Caroline.

4
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:17,285
I'm one of the co
founders of DataVise.

5
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:19,585
And DataVise, we are a small

6
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,905
studio specialized
in human data

7
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:24,465
interactions. that means that

8
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:26,865
our job is to make visible and

9
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,210
usable information that is

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,370
contained in very large
volumes of data.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,970
So, we design and we develop

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,310
tools or softwares
or application

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,850
that help people
understand data

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,730
or interact with
data or develop

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,030
new use with data.

16
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:44,625
And so we created that device

17
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,385
with my partners
because we were

18
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:47,905
convinced that
our brain doesn't

19
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,205
work like a computer.

20
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,825
And as humans, we need some

21
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:52,965
specific interfaces,

22
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:55,425
like visual interfaces,
for example,

23
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:56,805
to understand the complexity

24
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:57,780
inside the data.

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,460
And that's why at DataVise,

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,500
we are doing a lot of data

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,920
visualization,
like custom made,

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,440
tailor made data
visualization,

29
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,800
advanced data visualization,

30
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,380
like the one you
see, on the side,

31
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,220
which are projects we created

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,600
during the past years.

33
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,525
And so just to finish
with the presentation

34
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:17,505
, we are a team
of six people at

35
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,265
Dataverse with
a mix of designers

36
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:19,925
and developers,

37
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:22,725
and we are based in
Paris, in France.

38
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:28,325
So today I'm gonna
talk about a tool,

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,110
we have been working on since

40
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,930
the last month and
it's called Knowle.

41
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,470
It's a tool for mapping very

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,070
large corpus of documents,

43
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,070
a very large corpus
of knowledge.

44
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,990
And it's just
the first prototype

45
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,930
for the moment
you are seeing.

46
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,175
it's first,
the first prototype

47
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:45,915
that maps,

48
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:49,195
about fifty
thousand scientific

49
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:50,715
publication about
the coronavirus.

50
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:53,115
And with this tool,

51
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:54,955
we have a strong ambition,

52
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,680
really strong ambition.

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,920
We want to revolutionize
the way we,

54
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,160
search for
information in large

55
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,220
volumes of document.

56
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,140
And so that's the ambition,

57
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,460
and that's the talk
we'll be about.

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,520
And now I'm gonna
tell you a bit

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
more about how it goes in real

60
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,885
life and how we
have been working

61
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:16,485
on this. So what
was the trigger?

62
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:19,445
How did we start this
patient for such?

63
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:21,185
So when when the,

64
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,005
health crisis happens
in the spring,

65
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,110
we wondered what
we could do as

66
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,210
data visualization
experts because

67
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,130
we are not at all experts in

68
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,390
molecular biology
nor in virology

69
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,455
and we didn't know
how to produce mask.

70
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,715
But, we were good,

71
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,715
dealing with
information overload

72
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:42,835
and that emulsification,

73
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,055
and we discovered
that that was

74
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,995
a real problem
during this crisis.

75
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:50,355
for example, we
interviewed Ferdinand,

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,420
who is
a postdoctoral researcher

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
in a research center.

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,660
And he told us that
during this crisis,

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
he, he was flooded
with an avalanche

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,940
of preprints, papers,
and information,

81
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,365
and he feel he was stuck by

82
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:05,245
the amount of data.

83
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,345
It was impossible
for him to digest,

84
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:11,805
everything. and he was
not used to that,

85
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:14,125
he told us. He feels that,

86
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,880
it's good that there
is transparency

87
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,100
about all the research
works, but,

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,260
he was really afraid to waste

89
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,460
too much time if
he has to assess

90
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,760
all of all of this.

91
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,480
And in fact,
available information

92
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,380
about coronaviruses have never

93
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,965
been so rich or
accessible as it is now.

94
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,965
Because at the beginning
of the crisis,

95
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,565
lots of scientific
publishers,

96
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:40,265
gave free access
to their articles

97
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,085
about coronavirus,

98
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,825
to ease the research
about the disease.

99
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,765
But they also speed
up the review

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,660
and publication
process for new

101
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,160
articles, and this
led to several

102
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,760
thousands of new scientific

103
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,340
papers being published and

104
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,120
released each week during,

105
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,240
the month of April and May.

106
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:02,575
And this is
the biggest explosion

107
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,595
of scientific
literature ever.

108
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,895
So that was the trigger.

109
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,915
And now why do we
have a problem?

110
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:11,695
Because this practice
of open science,

111
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,375
it has a huge potential.

112
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,155
It's really fascinating,

113
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,850
but it also introduces
a new challenge,

114
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,830
which is discoverability.

115
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,130
So having too much content,

116
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,030
too much material,

117
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,430
we risk missing
something important,

118
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,410
something we will
not find because

119
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,350
it's drawn into the mass
of information.

120
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,582
That he's often
afraid of missing

121
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:31,333
an article that
already exists about,

122
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:31,508
the subject he's working on.

123
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:32,475
And for him,
checking if something

124
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:34,395
already exists or
not in the massive

125
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:35,375
amount of already published

126
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,300
scientific papers.

127
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,580
It's really complicated.

128
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,940
It costs too much
time, he told us.

129
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,020
And this discoverability
problem,

130
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,480
it can have very
concrete impact.

131
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,900
So, let's just
talk about one.

132
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,515
it has already claimed lives

133
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,675
during the Ibera
crisis in twenty

134
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,815
thirteen, for example.

135
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:05,475
this is a story told
by, Bernice Dan,

136
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,475
who is the chief
medical officer

137
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,900
of Liberia's
Ministry of Health.

138
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,140
so it's in
an article published

139
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,180
in the New York Times.

140
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,060
And she explained
that during the,

141
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,560
the, the eighties,
the early eighties,

142
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,540
there have been already one

143
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,460
scientific work that's pointed

144
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,895
out that kibaria needs to be

145
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,455
included in the area
where the Ebola

146
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,635
virus was endemic.

147
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:32,415
And this scientific work was

148
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,335
already warning
for the risk of

149
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,515
an epidemic and a risk
of a pandemic.

150
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,390
But this work was published in

151
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,250
some European
medical journals,

152
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,290
which are really
more confidential

153
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,630
than the English ones.

154
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,470
And so, it has
remained unknown

155
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,650
to local health
authority in Liberia.

156
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,190
And so,

157
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,085
that's how we had this crisis

158
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:56,965
with the Ebola
pandemic in Liberia

159
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:59,685
which costs some
lives in Africa.

160
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,685
And so this is
a terrible example

161
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,845
of what we call
dark knowledge.

162
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,890
And dark knowledge,

163
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,970
this is the part
of the scientific

164
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,790
knowledge that cannot be found

165
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,370
or cannot be reached
or cannot be used.

166
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,250
So back to our
coronavirus examples,

167
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,410
among
the scientific publication

168
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,910
we have been working on,

169
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,950
for this project,

170
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,405
so the publication that have

171
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:24,685
been opened and
published during

172
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,205
the crisis, we estimate that

173
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:27,725
fifty percent have never been

174
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:29,485
quoted and no mention by any

175
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,105
other scientific work.

176
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:33,325
And we've also discovered that

177
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,020
at least six percent of this

178
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,500
publication, in
not in English,

179
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,220
but in Chinese or
Korean or Arabic,

180
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,640
Russian. So those publication

181
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,540
who are not which
are not in English,

182
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,820
they will probably never be

183
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,095
found by any
American researcher

184
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:49,595
or any European researcher if

185
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,735
it's not the same language.

186
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,795
And that's always a problem if

187
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,155
a research work
cannot be found

188
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:56,075
because maybe this work was

189
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:57,515
bringing something
new and very

190
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,055
useful for all
the researchers.

191
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:01,350
But also if
several researchers

192
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,550
are working at
the same time on

193
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,470
the same subject
without knowing it,

194
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,870
but it's it's the it's
miss of time,

195
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,550
they they would have been able

196
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,630
to save some precious time if

197
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,450
they were aware.

198
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,430
And so at the end,

199
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,710
why do we do we have this

200
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,250
discoverability problem?

201
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:19,965
let's look at what
are our tools

202
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,325
today to deal with this

203
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,705
discoverability problem.

204
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:23,965
Most part of the time,

205
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,245
researchers are using search

206
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,225
engines like,
PubMed or Scopus,

207
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,990
but also Google,
Google Scholar,

208
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,570
or Microsoft
Academic when they

209
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,070
need to look for
scientific papers.

210
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,010
And according to us,
but not only us,

211
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,170
other other researchers have

212
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,135
this opinion, those
search engines

213
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,495
are not always the best way to

214
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,715
tackle with
this discoverability

215
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,695
problem. First,

216
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,615
for user experience reason,

217
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:49,515
because conventionally,

218
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,075
the presentation of
a search result,

219
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:54,855
it's a list paginated
like the one

220
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:56,715
you see here from
Google Scholar.

221
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,230
But let me ask,

222
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,530
how many of you are looking at

223
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,270
the result,

224
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,870
located on the third
page of results?

225
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,470
Only the third page.

226
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,550
I guess not many people,

227
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,595
and most part of the time,

228
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,375
there are hundreds
and hundreds

229
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:17,975
of pages of results.

230
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:20,855
So that's a lot
of articles that

231
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,615
you won't be able to find.

232
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,355
Second reason, it's
transparency reason.

233
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,390
There are arbitrariness
in the way

234
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,830
Google or Google
Scholar work,

235
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,770
but other search
engines also,

236
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,150
because the ranking algorithm

237
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,210
is not transparent.

238
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,710
we know, for example,
few things,

239
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,830
and we already know that there

240
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,605
are some bias.

241
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:42,125
For example, publication that

242
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,345
are in English language,

243
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:46,045
they are more likely to be on

244
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,985
the top of the list
than other language,

245
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:50,125
but also publication that have

246
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,885
been published in really well

247
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,345
known reviews or publication

248
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:55,620
that are already
cited by a lot

249
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,300
of articles. They
are more likely to,

250
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,380
have a good rank
and more likely

251
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,140
to be fine. So which is really

252
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,580
good when you are looking for

253
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,100
some conventional
definition of

254
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,795
a subject or when you
are looking for,

255
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,155
the common sense,

256
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,995
what most people are thinking

257
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:10,975
about the subject.

258
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,795
But maybe that's not the best

259
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,475
way to take a critical look at

260
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,075
the subject or to have a deep

261
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:17,755
understanding of a subject or

262
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:19,515
to find some raw material for

263
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,575
a scientific study.

264
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
So maybe we need to admit that

265
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,400
the most efficient
search engine

266
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,160
in your day to
day life when you

267
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,840
need to find a recipe
or the title

268
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,360
of a movie or
something like that,

269
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
it's not the best tool for

270
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,380
searching for scientific
information.

271
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:35,465
And the last reason,

272
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,185
I I wanted to point
out is search

273
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:41,065
engine, they are
not always good.

274
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:42,025
And in particular,

275
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,225
they're not good
when you don't

276
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:45,145
know to dis how when you don't

277
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:46,265
know how to describe what you

278
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:47,165
are looking for.

279
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,460
Because maybe you
don't know how

280
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,540
to name it, so maybe you don't

281
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,060
know what it looks like,

282
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,940
what you are looking for,

283
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,980
or maybe you don't even know

284
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,120
what you are looking for.

285
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,820
So for example,
imagine if you,

286
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,740
read a very
interesting article

287
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,100
about your research subject,

288
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,080
if you're a researcher,

289
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,035
and you would
like to find some

290
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:06,015
similar publications,

291
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,275
but that have been published

292
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,895
several years ago
in the past.

293
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,355
Or imagine if you
would like to

294
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,515
know if some other work is

295
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,195
refuting this article that you

296
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:15,935
find interesting.

297
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,180
Or imagine if you want to find

298
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,420
some other works
that are using

299
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,040
the same
experimental procedure

300
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,100
as this interesting
article but

301
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,960
for other disease,
for example.

302
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,760
Well, if you are in
this situation,

303
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,335
I wish you good luck to find

304
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,355
something with Google
or Google Scholar.

305
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:37,875
So in our opinion,

306
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,495
the user experience is key in

307
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:42,575
this solution. So, of course,

308
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,955
there have been
some innovation

309
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,315
in the field of information

310
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:47,380
research during
the last years,

311
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,280
like for example,

312
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,300
faceted filters or
similar content

313
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,680
recommendation, personalized

314
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,340
recommendation, or automatic

315
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,720
classification, NLP,

316
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,280
or entity recognition
and metadata

317
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,585
enrichments. But
every all this

318
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,345
is great and it does help,

319
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,265
but it's still
not enough in our

320
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,605
opinion because most
part of the time,

321
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:12,225
it's still designed
as black boxes,

322
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:13,525
like magic recommendations.

323
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,220
It's still designed
to give you

324
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,060
a quick answer
rather than give

325
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,160
giving you more
exploration capacity.

326
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,360
So the design choice
of search engines,

327
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,760
it's it's often,

328
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,720
to limit what you
can access easily,

329
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:29,265
And we think it's not the best

330
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,265
way to empower
user when they're

331
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,045
looking for some
scientific publication.

332
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:34,305
And according to us,

333
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,925
it's not
a recommendation problem

334
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:38,005
to deal with
this discoverability

335
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:39,925
crisis. It's not
about improving

336
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,800
how artificial intelligence

337
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,940
algorithm will
give you the best

338
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,080
three results ever.

339
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,580
Because we have to admit that

340
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,340
three result is
not enough when

341
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,640
you are looking
for publications

342
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,200
in your scientific field.

343
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:53,815
So according to us,

344
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,015
the solution is more about

345
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,855
improving
the experience to give

346
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:59,015
people access to much more

347
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,935
information than before and to

348
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,535
give people the right tools to

349
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,315
be able to navigate
to navigate

350
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,735
inside this very huge amounts

351
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:06,395
of information,

352
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:08,300
but to make them able to find

353
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
by themselves
relevant contents.

354
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,520
And according to us,

355
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,960
that's the real challenge.

356
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
And so how did we
work on this?

357
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,240
So let's,

358
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,940
share some few elements of our

359
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,495
methodology. So first,

360
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:23,735
we always work
with real data.

361
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,835
And, in this case, we,

362
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,175
for this prototype,

363
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,955
we are working with
two datasets.

364
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,995
the first one is LENS COVID

365
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,035
nineteen datasets.

366
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,810
LENS, it's an academic search

367
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,570
engine provided
by an independent

368
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,710
nonprofit organization.

369
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,350
They've selected
several thousand

370
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,330
of articles and patents with

371
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,910
that coronavirus.

372
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,665
The second dataset, it's,

373
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:47,945
called the nineteen,

374
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:49,225
it's the COVID-nineteen open

375
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:50,125
research datasets,

376
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,505
datasets which
contain more than,

377
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:55,485
two hundred thousand
scholarly articles,

378
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,120
and it has been
created by the Allen

379
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,740
Institute for Artificial
Intelligence.

380
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,080
So, those are the two datasets

381
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,060
we are working on.

382
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,300
We are doing a lot
of user research.

383
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,380
we are supporting
our experiments

384
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,540
with interviews
and user testing

385
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,460
with a small group of experts

386
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,260
or researchers.

387
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,865
We are mixing, the different

388
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:18,205
skills in our team
all the time.

389
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,285
For example, designers,
developers,

390
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,705
statisticians, we
are all working

391
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,465
together all
the time on the same

392
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:25,965
problems.

393
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,060
And also, we prototype
to solve problem.

394
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,160
So rather than
specifying a solution

395
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,860
to test, we want we prefer to

396
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,540
describe problem
and each member

397
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,700
in the team is in
charge to find

398
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,595
solution to try and to test.

399
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,355
And so in this project,

400
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,195
the problems we
wanted to solve,

401
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,915
were how to do
something that is,

402
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,595
that is good where
classic search

403
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:52,475
engines are not.

404
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,295
So for example,

405
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,115
how to allow users to better

406
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,795
understand the corpus as a as

407
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,870
a rule or how to help users

408
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,470
navigate in very large volumes

409
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,630
of content, or
how to help users

410
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,990
find something
that they cannot

411
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,030
describe, they don't know how

412
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,870
to describe, or how to reduce

413
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,230
the fear of missing out on

414
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,050
something important.

415
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,265
And we,

416
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:15,285
we have a strong
intuition that

417
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,525
mapping can be
an important part

418
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,265
of the solution.

419
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,325
In fact, it was Google
Maps rather than,

420
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:25,000
Google Search. So we were

421
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,520
interested in
the appearance of

422
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,340
Google Map,

423
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
and how this technology has

424
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,100
changed the use.

425
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,280
So we read this book,

426
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,400
which is really interesting,

427
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,940
which is called
Nebula's Again,

428
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,300
by Bill Kilday.

429
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,355
And there was this
citation that

430
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,855
was inspiring for us,
that that said,

431
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:41,955
no one after us,

432
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,555
no generation to
come will ever

433
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,995
be lost in the way that every

434
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:46,295
generation before was.

435
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,755
So our approach
was first to try

436
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,195
to map the application to give

437
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:51,810
another view of the corpus to

438
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,910
bring a physical
dimension in.

439
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,510
Because in data
visualization,

440
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,750
specialization of
the information

441
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,530
brings, a tangible
and physical

442
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,490
dimension to data.

443
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,030
And it plays a very positive

444
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,850
role in the ability of people

445
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,125
to appropriate
data and to play

446
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,645
with data. And
this is something

447
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,565
we have observed since a long

448
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:12,625
time in our profession.

449
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:15,425
So, it helps people,

450
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,925
specialization
of information,

451
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,605
it helps people get a mental

452
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:19,825
picture of the data.

453
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
It also helps people interact

454
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
with the data
because they feel

455
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
more able to get
their hands on

456
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,620
because this
physical dimension,

457
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,520
it breaks the black
box effect.

458
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,740
And also, specializations,

459
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,185
it also fosters
memorization and

460
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,625
all the theories
about the mental

461
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,165
palace are based on
this observation.

462
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:43,005
So, armed with this conviction

463
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,325
of mapping can be a solution,

464
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,000
we wanted to try
to what extent

465
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,740
this specialization,

466
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,960
this localization
could help to

467
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,660
better search in
scientific publication.

468
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,480
So, first we have been looking

469
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,980
for the best layout
to map the dataset.

470
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,955
So, we wanted to
find how to get

471
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,955
each publication
with a specific

472
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,135
location in the map.

473
00:16:04,135 --> 00:16:06,315
So try to visualize
this corpus.

474
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,955
So we produce a lot
of experiments

475
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,875
about how to position
the publication

476
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,970
in the physical space.

477
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,990
it's a bit like if we have,

478
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,990
the dataset was like a ball of

479
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,790
clay and we try
to mold the clay

480
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,750
to give it a shape,

481
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,710
according to specific part of

482
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,370
the dataset.

483
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,015
So at the end of
all this tested,

484
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,075
and this is really a sample of

485
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,375
everything that we tested.

486
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,015
at the end, we kept
two approaches.

487
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:38,375
The first one was a cetacean

488
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:39,895
network graph.

489
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,080
So the first approach,

490
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,120
it's a graph of
the cetacean's link.

491
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,380
In, it's a network graph.

492
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,540
That means, it's
it's built with

493
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,880
a force directed, layout.

494
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:54,515
So, how does it work?

495
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,055
Each node here is
a publication.

496
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:57,895
And the publication,

497
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:00,275
they are linked together when

498
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,795
they are citing each other.

499
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:03,715
So, each time a publication is

500
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,335
citing another work,

501
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:06,840
we have those links.

502
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,660
And we use
a physical simulation

503
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,700
where the links act
as attractors.

504
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,280
It's a bit like
if we have some

505
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,060
balls that are linked together

506
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,875
by stretch, rubber bands.

507
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,035
And as you let go,

508
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,855
all the rubber bands try to

509
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:26,135
bring the balls together and

510
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,135
the systems stabilize in a way

511
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,735
that optimize
the expression of

512
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:30,215
edge length.

513
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,930
So it gives an idea
of the organisation,

514
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,770
the structure of the corpus

515
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,770
according to
the citation's link.

516
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,990
And we know that
citation's links,

517
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,110
they are very important in

518
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,310
scientific research because

519
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,550
science is made
by iteration and

520
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,690
progressive refutation.

521
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:46,955
So we were really
interested in

522
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,855
finding a way, to make this,

523
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,655
to make visible this iterative

524
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:53,835
nature of science,

525
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:55,615
to show the making
of science,

526
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:57,375
thanks to the station links.

527
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,490
And also, with this graph,

528
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,950
we were able to make visible

529
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,110
this dark knowledge
in the datasets.

530
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,690
So I don't know
if you have seen

531
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,090
it well,

532
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,050
but let me if you I don't know

533
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,290
if you see,
the corolla here at

534
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,955
the periphery of the graph.

535
00:18:14,335 --> 00:18:16,735
So this corolla is made of all

536
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:18,975
the articles that
are not linked

537
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,895
to others. So
the fifty percent

538
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,495
of publication that are not

539
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,035
cited by anyone else.

540
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:27,720
So in this map, they
are still here.

541
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,620
we have this corolla,

542
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,700
which is the dark
knowledge that

543
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,460
usually you don't see and hear

544
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,920
it's here at the border.

545
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,360
It remains visible
in this map.

546
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,115
The second experiment,

547
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:44,995
the second way to
map this corpus,

548
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,275
it's a dimension
reduction map.

549
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,475
So here,

550
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:52,175
it's really here where we used

551
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,950
machine learning And here we

552
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,410
have another way to,

553
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,250
organize the datasets.

554
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,110
We reduce each publication to

555
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,410
a metadata sequence.

556
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,350
So it's like a unique sequence

557
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,355
of keywords and
information that

558
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,735
reflects each publication.

559
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,295
So we use twenty
six thousand,

560
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:13,935
different keywords to describe

561
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:14,655
the publications,

562
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:16,875
and each publication can be

563
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,435
summarized by
a sequence of one

564
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:21,790
and zero describing if each

565
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,130
keyword belongs or not
to the publication

566
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,770
. And after that, we have,

567
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,290
so this gives us vectors in

568
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,610
twenty six thousand
dimensions.

569
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,835
It's like coordinates
in a multi

570
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,995
dimensional space with twenty

571
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,695
six thousand dimension.

572
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:42,915
And then we use
a machine learning

573
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,415
algorithm, which
is called UMAP,

574
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,795
to switch position from this

575
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:51,180
multi dimensional
space into a three

576
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,860
d or two d space.
So we use UMAP.

577
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,540
It's an algorithm in the same

578
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,080
family as t SNE,

579
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,560
but it's better than
t SNE for our goal.

580
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,160
And this kind of algorithm

581
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,235
translates proximity motion in

582
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,815
a multidimensional
space into proximity,

583
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:10,655
into a three-dimensional
space.

584
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,035
in a way that
articles that are

585
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,600
close to each other
in the twenty

586
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
six thousand
dimension space are

587
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,360
still close to each other in

588
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,260
the two dimensional space.

589
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,560
And articles that
were far away

590
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,320
in the multi dimensional space

591
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,220
are still far away
in the two d space.

592
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:31,445
So it's a way to translate,

593
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,085
twenty six thousand dimension

594
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,385
into two dimension
while preserving

595
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:37,125
the topology.

596
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,445
And so at the end, articles,

597
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:42,805
which have
the closest sequences

598
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,465
of keywords are close to each

599
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:45,240
other in the map.

600
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,300
So here, the idea
was to replicate,

601
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,600
the physical
experience that you

602
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,200
have when you are in
the library and,

603
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,900
you walk around the different

604
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,455
shelves and you
find a book that

605
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,215
is interesting
for you and step

606
00:21:02,215 --> 00:21:03,995
by step close to each other,

607
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,995
you look at, all the books,

608
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:08,615
and you will find
something that

609
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,235
you are not really
looking for.

610
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,740
So we add these
two ways to draw,

611
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,200
the map of the corpus.

612
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,720
And we they were
both interesting.

613
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,340
And, so we made
some user tests

614
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,420
to determine which
one was the most

615
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,960
easy to use and
to understand.

616
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,545
And at the end,

617
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,785
the dimension map
the the reduction

618
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:33,545
the the dimension
reduction map was,

619
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:35,245
really better understood,

620
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,385
without any doubt. So
it's really clear.

621
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:40,080
Tester felt more comfortable

622
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,400
with this map. They interacted

623
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,700
with it more
naturally than with

624
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,760
the citation graph.

625
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,140
And also, tester told us that

626
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,760
it was easier to understand.

627
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,520
It makes more sense for them.

628
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,325
So we,

629
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,405
have seen here
the potential of

630
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,405
machine learning for our work

631
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,305
at that moment,

632
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:01,505
where we achieve
a better organization,

633
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,185
a better localization,

634
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:04,865
thanks to machine learning.

635
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,850
So let's talk about
another point,

636
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,230
but just let me find alright.

637
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,750
Just one minute. I'm
short of battery.

638
00:22:33,015 --> 00:23:05,370
It's Okay.

639
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,730
Sorry about that.

640
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,430
My plug was not
working anymore,

641
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,890
but, I'm okay now.

642
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,750
So, something else I wanted to

643
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,535
tell you about, it's
the colors because,

644
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,355
it's important to hear,

645
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,815
if you see the two, maps.

646
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,475
The one on the left
and the one

647
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:25,635
on the right, it's
there is a huge

648
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,235
difference in your ability to

649
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:31,160
save space and, to
find some location.

650
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,120
So we need to have some colors

651
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,760
that are relevant
and here colors

652
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,520
are reflecting clusters.

653
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,840
So, to get these clusters,

654
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,340
we also use a machine learning

655
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,735
algorithm. We use an algorithm

656
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,995
that is is called HDB scan.

657
00:23:49,935 --> 00:23:52,115
it's a hierarchical clustering

658
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:53,395
algorithm algorithm.

659
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:56,175
That means that we are able to

660
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:58,975
find some parent cluster and

661
00:23:58,975 --> 00:24:00,435
children cluster inside.

662
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,450
And it's a clustering
by density.

663
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,610
That means that
we can identify

664
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,770
some clusters even in complex

665
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,450
shapes in the map.

666
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,130
And, to, find those clusters,

667
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,815
we tried different different

668
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:20,515
implementation of
this algorithm.

669
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:22,995
So HDB scan,

670
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:26,355
was better than
a usual clustering

671
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:27,955
algorithm like Kamin's,

672
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:31,075
in its ability to
detect complex shapes.

673
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,740
But you can detect
those complex

674
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,420
shape in two dimension,

675
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,260
but also in three dimension,

676
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,260
four dimension,

677
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,500
and any of the different,

678
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
space we can
create with this,

679
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:48,145
twenty thousand twenty
six thousand as,

680
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:50,085
dimension we add on.

681
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:52,565
So we made some
different tried

682
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:53,285
different tests.

683
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,345
And at the end,

684
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,465
we found that implementing
the clustering

685
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:59,145
algorithm in a ten dimensional

686
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,120
space was, give us
the best result.

687
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,720
Just a a small,
point again about,

688
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,260
the caller. First,

689
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,000
it's it shows you
the different

690
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,125
clusters, but also we can show

691
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,265
you some other dimension.

692
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:19,905
For example, I'm sorry.

693
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,405
Just for example,
here, we can,

694
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:27,165
use the color to
display to show

695
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,385
the number of citation.

696
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,770
So we can change dynamically

697
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,170
the color of the of
the publication.

698
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,990
And here you have some other

699
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,110
patterns that appears.

700
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,910
And for example,

701
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,170
we are able to see
that the cluster

702
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,070
talking about coronavirus in

703
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,155
biology and virology
is the most

704
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,175
cited in in this corpus.

705
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:48,355
And just let me give you few,

706
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:53,175
explanation about,
the class the labels.

707
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:57,015
So the labels, we
also find them,

708
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,190
using some data treatments.

709
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,150
And here we try
to find the most

710
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,910
used keywords to
describe the cluster.

711
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,870
So for example,

712
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:13,815
we found the keywords that are

713
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:16,375
most frequent in
the cluster and

714
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,975
not in the rest
of the corpus,

715
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:19,575
in comparison with the rest of

716
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:20,235
the corpus.

717
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:22,955
So let's,

718
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,390
finish with the rest
of the interface

719
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,210
because this map is
not working alone.

720
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,290
there are some user interface

721
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,270
element to form
a tool and give

722
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,010
users some features
to explore further.

723
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:40,695
So we have, like
in Google, like,

724
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:43,015
the ability to zoom,
zoom in, zoom out,

725
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:43,815
or to pan,

726
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:46,615
or to hover any
article and see

727
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:47,355
its link.

728
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:49,195
But we have also,

729
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,560
the ability to use
some filters.

730
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,980
So for example,

731
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,580
it's really basic because it's

732
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,480
just a prototype,

733
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,140
and we have been focusing more

734
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,580
on the map. But so you can add

735
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,500
some filters for
the year or for

736
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,200
the field of study
or the keywords.

737
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,495
And when hovering, a filter,

738
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:07,495
you see directly which part of

739
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:08,795
the map is concerned.

740
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,195
And so, you can create this

741
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,335
filtered version of the map

742
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:15,355
according to what's
important for you.

743
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,415
And you can also
display the list

744
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:18,395
of all the publication.

745
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,190
and you have
this correspondence

746
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,850
between the map and the list.

747
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,770
You can investigate further on

748
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,690
one article. So,

749
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,450
you can select an article and

750
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,250
you can see it's metadata and

751
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,595
the abstract and everything we

752
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:37,015
get we we have for
this article.

753
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,535
But also you can
explore the citation

754
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:41,575
the citations.

755
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:45,475
So papers which
are citing this

756
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:48,295
paper or references
the bibliography.

757
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,480
And we can, for example,

758
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,800
display the list
of all the citing

759
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,700
papers and see where they are

760
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,380
on the map, if they are from

761
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,300
different fields
of study or if

762
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,480
they are from the same
fields of study.

763
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:04,345
So this is really, useful.

764
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:07,125
And also we can display a list

765
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,345
of similar publications.

766
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:10,405
So if you find something that

767
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,525
looks good for you,

768
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,665
we can automatically,

769
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,245
find the closest
one and display

770
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,385
the closest one.

771
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,840
So this,

772
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,540
is the first prototype we have

773
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,000
been working on,
and, voluntarily,

774
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,320
we have not put any
search box yet.

775
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,240
So this is really,

776
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:34,155
because we wanted to keep this

777
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,995
for later. We wanted first to

778
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:38,635
explore the potential
of the map

779
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,495
and the complementarity
between,

780
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:43,515
the search, options
like filters

781
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,215
and things like
that on the map.

782
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,950
And so the questions we ask

783
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,850
ourselves is how does
it fit together,

784
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,210
this map,

785
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,830
with the user
experience of a classic

786
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,830
map like Google
Map and the more

787
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,830
classic user
experience element

788
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,450
like the filters on the list?

789
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:05,015
And we have done user
testing on that,

790
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:08,395
and the user test
show that users,

791
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,195
still use the map relatively

792
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:13,515
little as
an exploration medium,

793
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,075
but more as a feedback,

794
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,190
as a way to evaluate
the results

795
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,610
of their search,
as a way to see,

796
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,850
if the filters they're using,

797
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,750
is it relevant
for them or not,

798
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,990
or how many, result they will

799
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,510
get or not. But
for the moment,

800
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,270
the map is not
really the first

801
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,835
way to interact
and to look for

802
00:29:33,835 --> 00:29:36,575
something. So this
is interesting,

803
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,195
but we would like to see to

804
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,575
investigate how we can,

805
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:43,035
make the most out of this map

806
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:44,575
for the searching capacity.

807
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,740
And so, we have still
a long way to go,

808
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,040
still progress to
make to succeed

809
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,880
in this challenge of improving

810
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,480
the research experience in

811
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,700
scientific publication.

812
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,420
But this is just
a first step.

813
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:01,175
The next step,

814
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,935
we would like to
try to visualize

815
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,655
relations between entities

816
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,055
extracted from
the publication.

817
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:12,935
So, not anymore mapping
the publication

818
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:15,495
and the relation
between articles,

819
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,880
but mapping
the relation between

820
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,680
entities relation between what

821
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,960
articles are talking about.

822
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,720
For example, we can extract

823
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,220
disease or molecules
or viruses,

824
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,700
part of the body,
gene, and so on.

825
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,475
And all these entities are

826
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:32,155
discussed inside publication.

827
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,435
So if you read one, two,

828
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:34,315
or three publication,

829
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,835
you will see
the relation between

830
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,575
those entities.

831
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,035
for example, you will see that

832
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:40,635
an article is
making a relation

833
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,235
between a virus and a part of

834
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:44,095
the body on a virus
and a gene.

835
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,990
But you cannot do this for

836
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,670
thousand and thousand
of publication.

837
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,690
But by automatic
extraction and

838
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,390
by visualization,
specialization,

839
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,190
we can make appears
the relations

840
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,245
between entities for
the whole corpus.

841
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:02,385
And maybe we will make some

842
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:04,385
correlation appear
that you will

843
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:06,405
not have seen
other way because

844
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,305
this is what you
can do when you

845
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:10,465
can visualize such
massive amount

846
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:11,285
of relations.

847
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,200
So I'm hope,

848
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,900
so this will be
an expert type.

849
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,420
We are working on
it at the moment,

850
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,400
and I really hope
I will be able

851
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,195
to share it with you soon and

852
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:27,835
to give you some more feedback

853
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:30,095
so that this mapping,

854
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:34,075
the capacity to
improve the way

855
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:34,735
we search.

856
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:40,710
So this, right, this
is the the end.

857
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,070
This is the story of what we

858
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,590
have been working on
since the beginning

859
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,490
of this crisis.

860
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,750
and I'm I'm really curious of

861
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,970
your question now.

862
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,030
So I'm gonna have a look at

863
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:58,225
the at the chat.
Hi, Caroline.

864
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:00,605
It's James here. Can
you hear me okay?

865
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:01,885
Yes. I can hear you. Cool.

866
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:03,325
Sorry I was late
at the start.

867
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:04,765
There was a previous session

868
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:05,745
that I overran.

869
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
So, yeah, if
people can send in

870
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,520
questions. I don't
know whether

871
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,800
you can see there are some

872
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,380
questions already
in the chat box,

873
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,860
that have been
coming through.

874
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,260
I can see some
people are typing

875
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,140
as well.

876
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:22,765
Yeah. Alright.

877
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:25,905
I don't know if I go
over the question

878
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:32,445
by order of if, I can,

879
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,605
I can work backwards if that's

880
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,465
helpful and read
out the questions.

881
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,890
Alright. so question,

882
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,210
did you experiment
with modularity

883
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,530
based clustering methods?

884
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,050
How did you validate,

885
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,650
or test the clusters
with users?

886
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:57,175
Alright. We tried mostly,

887
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,035
we tried different algorithm,

888
00:32:59,095 --> 00:32:59,895
but we were,

889
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:03,195
we really wanted to
have a hierarchical

890
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:05,115
clustering algorithm.

891
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:07,450
And so we tried several,

892
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,110
and we tested
them with users.

893
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,310
And
the the the the most important

894
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,670
thing was how people feel they

895
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,830
can find something
in the map.

896
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,455
So we were showing them up to

897
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,715
new testers. And if they feel

898
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:27,015
they were lost
and if they feel

899
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:30,455
it was like a mess, we, yeah,

900
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,395
we were not keeping
the algorithm.

901
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,350
Great. Thanks.
another question.

902
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,510
How did you test the layout

903
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,750
algorithm to arrive
at the dimensionality

904
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:47,665
reduction method,
was better? Yeah.

905
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:49,765
It's it's the same thing.

906
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:53,265
we first,

907
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,665
we we see what's
the result when

908
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:58,405
we map the,
the the publication.

909
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:00,245
So what's the result
of the algorithm?

910
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:02,190
Does does it bring something

911
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,210
better in terms of
specialization,

912
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,770
in terms of capacity to,

913
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,750
to have your publication that

914
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,370
are not all at the same,

915
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:15,095
in the same ball
at the center,

916
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,035
but that are
positioned differently

917
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:17,835
in the space.

918
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:19,915
So most mostly,

919
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,335
the idea was to find the best

920
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:26,775
algorithm to create some space

921
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:27,595
with more,

922
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
publication and
some space with

923
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,540
the lesson to see
those clusters

924
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,480
appears. So the capacity of

925
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,275
making clusters
appear was a very

926
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:42,375
important point in evaluation

927
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:45,175
of the different
algorithm we tried.

928
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:46,595
And after that,

929
00:34:46,595 --> 00:34:48,615
once when we feel
it was good,

930
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:51,875
we show it to our testers and

931
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,640
we ask some feedbacks and we

932
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,020
give testers some basic
task of finding,

933
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,800
publication inside the map or

934
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,320
describing the map and we see

935
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,940
which one was more
efficient. Great.

936
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,840
Thanks. another question.

937
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,520
You mentioned that users are

938
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,315
less likely to explore
using this map.

939
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,775
How have you
attempted to enable

940
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:14,835
this exploration?

941
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:18,655
Sorry.

942
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,155
I missed the users
are more likely to.

943
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,730
So you mentioned
that users are

944
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,970
less likely to explore
using this map.

945
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,570
So I think
the question is around

946
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,650
what plans do you have for

947
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,390
developing exploration,
functionality,

948
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,885
tools, capabilities? Yeah.

949
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:42,125
RID is really to
have an interface

950
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:45,485
that makes some
rebounds between

951
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:48,710
classic, filtering
and searching

952
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,370
options and the map.

953
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,830
Like, if all the interface was

954
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,550
reacting at the same
time when you,

955
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,790
perform some action.

956
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,235
So, for example,

957
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:04,475
if you zoom somewhere
in the map,

958
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,115
it should,

959
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:09,055
update at the same
time the filters

960
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:09,755
on the list.

961
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:13,210
And if you feel one filter is

962
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,250
interesting for you,

963
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,670
it's which it should
show directly

964
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,170
how part of the map,
you will lost.

965
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,930
Or if you, get interested by,

966
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,370
for example, one article,

967
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,885
you should be able to see at

968
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:28,865
the same time,

969
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,325
you can you you you should be

970
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:32,685
able to read at the same time

971
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:34,285
the abstract and see what's

972
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:35,985
the impact of this article,

973
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:39,325
on the rest of
the scientific field,

974
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:40,925
for example. So,

975
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,090
the idea is giving you more

976
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,710
options to go from one article

977
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,770
to another, to go from one ID

978
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,930
to another, to go
from one keyword

979
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,370
to another because it's really

980
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,010
complicated to know which one

981
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,005
is the good keyword for you.

982
00:36:58,005 --> 00:36:59,785
And this is something that is

983
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:01,625
really common in
the interviews,

984
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:06,185
we made is that,
at the beginning,

985
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:09,545
people are are naming things

986
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,930
differently. and according to

987
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,910
the location,

988
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,890
people are describing things

989
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,270
differently in
the publication.

990
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,330
So if you have to
rely only on one,

991
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,430
two, three keywords,
you're really,

992
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:25,545
there is really
a risk that you

993
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:26,265
miss something.

994
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:29,065
And that's exactly the fear of

995
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:31,305
researchers, who
are working on

996
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:32,525
a specific subject.

997
00:37:33,225 --> 00:37:34,825
it's the fear of missing out

998
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:36,265
some work that
have been already

999
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:37,530
published and that they don't

1000
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,050
find because they don't know

1001
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,970
what is the correct keyword to

1002
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:41,710
find that.

1003
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,950
and this is why,

1004
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,330
any option to
interact with this,

1005
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,550
corpus of document
that doesn't,

1006
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,495
ask you to describe
something with Word,

1007
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:56,635
but by proximity,

1008
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:58,955
by going from one to another,

1009
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:01,015
clicking here,
clicking here to

1010
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,275
see what's the result.
It's it's good.

1011
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,150
Perfect. Thanks.
Thanks, Caroline.

1012
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,070
that was a really fantastic,

1013
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,410
really interesting talk.

1014
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,010
hopefully, you've
had a look at

1015
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,530
some of the, compliments in

1016
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,650
the chat channel.

1017
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,170
I think a lot of
people enjoyed

1018
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,630
that and found it
really interesting.

1019
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,135
I'd ask if, anyone
has any questions,

1020
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:23,635
further questions
for Caroline,

1021
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,535
just post in
the the leaders, Slack,

1022
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:28,835
chat, and, hopefully,

1023
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:31,015
she'll be around
to pick that up.

1024
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
So now we're moving on to,

1025
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,860
the US time zone, coverage.

1026
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,960
So we have the welcome address

1027
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,400
for the for the US,

1028
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,000
part of the conference.

1029
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,995
So, I would direct
people over to there,

1030
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:47,915
and we'll we'll
get started with

1031
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,695
handing over
the virtual baton.

1032
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,355
Thanks. Thanks very much all.

1033
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:55,775
Thanks, Caroline.
Thank you, everyone.

1034
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:58,975
I remain available in
the Slack channel,

1035
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,980
so don't don't hesitate to ask

1036
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,280
your question. Yeah. Great.

1037
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,975
Thank you very much.
