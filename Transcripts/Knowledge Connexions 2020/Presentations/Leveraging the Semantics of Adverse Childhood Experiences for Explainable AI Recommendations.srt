1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
I'm so excited to
be here today,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,400
and, I am talk talking to you

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,060
from Detroit, Michigan,
United States.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,320
But I, as Arie
mentioned, I work,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,700
in Tennessee.

6
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,435
So I have a PhD in computer

7
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:18,055
science from Wayne
State University,

8
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:21,260
and I started working for,

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,340
the Oak Ridge
National Lab Center

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,260
for Biomedical Informatics at

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,020
University of Tennessee Health

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,000
Science Center.

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,140
We're also affiliated with Le

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,920
Bonheur Children's Hospital.

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,745
we work in
the Research Foundation

16
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,665
Institute. so we're affiliated

17
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:38,645
with that as well.

18
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,445
And, me and my team,

19
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:43,445
we are working in
the population

20
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,965
health intelligence lab.

21
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:47,125
We're quite
multi multidisciplinary

22
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:49,860
team, and,

23
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,020
we we I work for doctor Arash

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,940
Shapanijad. this talk is based

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,860
on a recent journal article I

26
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,820
published in,

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,120
GMIR Journal for
Biomedical Informatics.

28
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,685
And, the motivation for this

29
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:07,445
work was based on a family

30
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,785
resilience initiative
started in,

31
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:15,680
about now, like,
almost two years ago,

32
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,580
and, it's a screening program

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,440
for adverse
childhood experiences

34
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,460
and social determinants
of health.

35
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,900
And then the rest
of the talk,

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,020
I'm just gonna be referring to

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,960
those as ACs and SDOWADGE.

38
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,015
The program addresses social

39
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,875
needs through
community outreach

40
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:34,815
coordinators, and
they have a strong,

41
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,395
resource referral
referral network.

42
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:39,475
And they have these quarterly

43
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:41,820
reports where they
show statistics

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,040
of cases that have
been enrolled

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,860
in the program,

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,580
and they also have descriptive

47
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,880
anecdotes of the the clients

48
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,640
that have been coming
to the clinic.

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,940
And so it's voluntary.

50
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,480
It happens right
after the primary

51
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,805
care visit, And, they,

52
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,245
they detect issues,
such as, you know,

53
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,685
when it comes to
adverse childhood

54
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:06,005
experiences, they
detect issues

55
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,025
related to child
behavioral issues.

56
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,945
When it comes to
social determinants

57
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,720
of health, the most prevalent

58
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,960
issues are housing,
food insecurities,

59
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,580
and so on. And in terms of

60
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,500
follow-up activities
with their

61
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,400
referral networks,

62
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,880
they do follow-up appointments

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,100
with psychiatric
psych you know,

64
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,120
psychological appointments or

65
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:28,625
clinical appointments
and so on.

66
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,265
And so the the current process

67
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,965
is semi automated or manual in

68
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,245
in for the most case.

69
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:37,805
And, we wanted to provide them

70
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:39,885
with a tool that
can help automate

71
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,185
the screening process.

72
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,380
and so I just wanted
to highlight that,

73
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,740
you know, some of
the challenges

74
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,500
in digital health is that we

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,080
want to design
intelligent tools,

76
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,340
and that,

77
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,980
will reduce the effort done by

78
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,675
users both in
data entry and in

79
00:02:57,675 --> 00:02:58,575
knowledge acquisition.

80
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,555
And users could be, you know,

81
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,835
caregivers, talking
to the, you know,

82
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,115
health care professional about

83
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,115
their issues and
the the health

84
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,575
care professional itself,

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,150
himself or herself
in the knowledge

86
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,190
acquisition process,

87
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,390
and what do they do with this

88
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,230
collected knowledge.

89
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,790
And so we really want good,

90
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,810
data input modalities.

91
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,030
And, in in Michigan mission

92
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,650
critical areas like medicine,

93
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,685
we also want to
provide explanations

94
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:30,185
of why this decision was made

95
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:32,985
to provide, you know,
transparency and,

96
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:37,625
trustworthiness.
now the the current

97
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,800
process is based off standard

98
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,160
questionnaires that they have

99
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,000
developed and agreed upon for

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
social determinants and other

101
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,400
childhood experiences.

102
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,940
They have a lot of questions

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,260
that caregivers have
to go through.

104
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
These questions are not only

105
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,960
overwhelming, but
also sometimes

106
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,695
irrelevant. And,

107
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:57,695
sometimes there
are hidden issues

108
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,375
that the caregiver is not even

109
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,375
aware of that we
want to uncover

110
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,275
in those conversations.

111
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,575
And so these tools
are good for

112
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:05,375
spotting the issues,

113
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,075
but we need tools to,

114
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:08,995
help people navigate,

115
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,730
help the caregivers navigate

116
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,490
those in need to resources,

117
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,310
and we want those
tools to mimic

118
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,210
human intelligence.

119
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,750
And one way to you know,

120
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,590
the most important aspect that

121
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,850
humans use to make
decisions is context.

122
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,290
So context is key.

123
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:26,475
And we also want to be able to

124
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,055
explain why
a decision was made.

125
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:31,775
So, we need to provide
an explanation,

126
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:33,455
and we want for
that explanation

127
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:35,275
to be based on
evidence, you know,

128
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,090
research or public
knowledge, evidence.

129
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,750
And one way to
achieve, you know,

130
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,430
explainability in AI,

131
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,190
and I'm sure so many people in

132
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,210
the conference
today and yesterday

133
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,030
and the day before have been

134
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,390
talking about
knowledge graphs.

135
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,545
And I know,

136
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,425
you probably by now
know the importance

137
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:56,025
of knowledge graphs
and what they mean.

138
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,085
But just briefly,

139
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,205
because we wanted
to build a tool,

140
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:01,945
you know, we wanted to,

141
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,785
utilize knowledge graphs for

142
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,145
building that tool for AI

143
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:07,300
explainability.
And so, you know,

144
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,820
one way to define knowledge is

145
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,620
that it's, you know,

146
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,800
it's data or facts associated

147
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,000
with context.

148
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,820
In context, one way to look at

149
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,900
context is a it's
an overloaded term,

150
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,460
but, well,

151
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,940
one way is to define it by

152
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,700
semantics or metadata that it

153
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,775
describe those facts and put

154
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:25,775
conversations in context.

155
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,955
and so, knowledge
graphs help,

156
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:31,455
open the black box in AI.

157
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:33,915
And, the other
important aspect

158
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,355
of knowledge graphs is they

159
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:37,375
generalize based on structures

160
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,860
on structure
rather than data,

161
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
which is what classic machine

162
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,360
learning does in
training models and,

163
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,160
you know, trying them
on new new data.

164
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,480
And so, in terms
of applications,

165
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,895
digital assistants or chatbots

166
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,715
or conversation agents,

167
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:54,835
there are many terms.

168
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:56,195
They incorporate
knowledge graphs

169
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,415
into dialogue interactions.

170
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:00,115
And so users would be would be

171
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:01,795
the input from the user would

172
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,255
be data and context,

173
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,950
and those serve as parameters

174
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,010
to queries. We
run those queries

175
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,970
by knowledge graphs.

176
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,130
We personalize
and enrich those

177
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,950
knowledge graphs.

178
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,350
And then,
the other application

179
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,930
is recommendation systems that

180
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,530
can use those query results to

181
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,965
detect personalized resource

182
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,985
suggestions. and
so our approach

183
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:24,085
for AI explainability
is both,

184
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:25,745
it's knowledge driven.

185
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,185
It's it uses
knowledge graphs,

186
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:29,025
but it's but it's
also evidence based.

187
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,225
So we would like to provide

188
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,600
explanations both
based on the graph

189
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,540
structure and past
traceability,

190
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,380
but also based on,
you know, research,

191
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,340
published or, you know,

192
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,660
trials registered.

193
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,320
And so we want to provide some

194
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,395
quantitative, data.

195
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,715
And so starting
from the bottom,

196
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:53,415
we have been working
on something

197
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,095
that we called knowledge based

198
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,715
urban population
health observatory.

199
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,475
So we collect evidence,

200
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,715
and this evidence
is not individual

201
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,575
level evidence.

202
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:02,715
It's public evidence.

203
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,900
It's community
level indicators

204
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,280
collected from several sources

205
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,800
like US Census surveys
and, you know,

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
Esri and CDC. And,

207
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
we also have local community

208
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,660
partners such as
Memphis Property Hub,

209
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:22,345
where we have
data about things

210
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:23,165
like transportation,

211
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:26,985
things like walkability scores

212
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:27,805
in your neighborhood,

213
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:30,745
and that is a different level

214
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:31,885
of geographic granularity.

215
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,620
So ZIP codes, census tract,

216
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,320
and census per group levels,

217
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,940
and sometimes at
the, you know,

218
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,380
the the the parcel level.

219
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,160
And so we, we have
been collecting

220
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,380
that data about we call them

221
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,820
social determinants of health

222
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,780
for a while now,

223
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,975
and we have been
doing a lot of

224
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,115
association studies,

225
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,675
linking those to
health outcomes.

226
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,375
And on on the top
of that, we,

227
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,455
you know so we we
process that raw data,

228
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:58,895
and we try to come up with

229
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,835
epidemiological, you know,

230
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:02,460
metric metric scores,

231
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,320
like affinity scores and,

232
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,800
results of association
analysis.

233
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,340
And so that's
the evidence that

234
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,000
we're collecting.

235
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,020
And, also, we utilize semantic

236
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,040
web technologies
such as ontologies.

237
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,440
We define epidemiological
ontologies,

238
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,425
surveillance ontologies, and,

239
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:22,225
we use those to do
semantic inference.

240
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,005
And we feed
concepts from those

241
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,445
ontologies into
building knowledge

242
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:27,165
graphs as well.

243
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:29,725
And so that provides
a good base

244
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:30,465
for applications.

245
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,680
And so going to the top,
we, you know,

246
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,180
we expose the results
through APIs,

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,700
and there are so
many technologies

248
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,960
out there to,
query graphs or,

249
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,240
you know, either locally or

250
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
globally depending
on the domain.

251
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,815
And then, we provide
explanations.

252
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,975
So we provide
recommendations,

253
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,895
but we also explain those.

254
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,835
And because we
perform different

255
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,835
kind of analysis
techniques, either,

256
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,595
you know, causal inference or

257
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:00,035
association, regressed through

258
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:01,015
regression analysis,

259
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:02,870
we can pull the results,

260
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,230
and we can actually provide

261
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,670
explanations of why we made

262
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,490
certain recommendations.

263
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,750
And we feed those
into the applications

264
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,350
such as digital assistance and

265
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,230
recommended systems,

266
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,070
and we can even
do analytics on

267
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,145
aggregated data
based on previous

268
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:21,225
conversations.
and so, you know,

269
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,905
since this is this
is not, you know,

270
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:23,945
a research conference,

271
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:25,305
I just wanted to
highlight that

272
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:28,025
we in in building this tool of

273
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,485
utilized several
technologies,

274
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,490
and you probably,

275
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,150
heard about some of this in

276
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,030
the in the conference.

277
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,630
So I to build the ontology,

278
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,990
we utilized to build the QA

279
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,190
agent or the chatbot.

280
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,350
We utilized Google
Dialogflow and,

281
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,505
also the the Google
Cloud platform.

282
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:48,065
And for the knowledge graph,

283
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:50,705
we utilize the Neo
four g graph

284
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,665
technology and
a couple of plugins

285
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,985
associated with that
technology as well.

286
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,990
As for the anthology,

287
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,210
it was developed by,

288
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,010
previous post doc
that was working

289
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,910
with my PI, and he,
in that anthology,

290
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,230
he encoded epidemiological

291
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,215
knowledge related to social

292
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:12,435
determinants of health,

293
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:13,795
adverse childhood
experiences,

294
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,995
and how those cause certain

295
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,975
negative health outcomes and

296
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,815
what kind of interventions we

297
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:23,615
can do in order to
mitigate those,

298
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,780
outcomes. And the ontology

299
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,700
includes both concept
hierarchies.

300
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,620
And I'm sure through
the conference

301
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,060
today, you've you've,

302
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,680
seen several ontologies
and, you know,

303
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,580
what they mean.

304
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,280
But, this is a very
conceptual diagram,

305
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,085
but, it's a it's
a comprehensive

306
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,405
ontology of both
concept hierarchies,

307
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,665
object properties
between the different

308
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:46,705
context as well as,

309
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,845
data type properties
and also,

310
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,485
you know, axioms,

311
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,310
epidemiological
causal relationships

312
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,190
through axioms.

313
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,670
And in building
this ontology,

314
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,890
we, or young, he,

315
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,630
he referred to those standard

316
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,690
questionnaires,
and so he relied

317
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,050
on surveys on,

318
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,125
basic foundation
research papers

319
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,645
on the topic, and,

320
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:18,225
he also published
the anthology in RDFS,

321
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:20,625
OWL format on Pyoportals.

322
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:23,820
It's available and, you know,

323
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,340
for use by other researchers.

324
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,440
And he did reuse
existing ontologies,

325
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,660
but, we we wanted to put that

326
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,760
ontology into use
into a tool.

327
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,200
And so, moving to
the QA agent,

328
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,685
as I said, we utilized Google

329
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:38,885
Dialogflow. And,

330
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,485
for those who are not familiar

331
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:41,625
with this framework,

332
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,765
just like IBM Watson and other

333
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:47,045
frameworks, we
have to start by,

334
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,890
building an agent.

335
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,570
So we have to
define an agent,

336
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,070
and let's say we
have I'm working

337
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,810
on different
application domains.

338
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,070
One domain is this
AC civilians.

339
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,610
Then I have to, you know,

340
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,795
I have to define an agent for

341
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:02,995
each specific problem.

342
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,275
And within that agent,

343
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,595
I have to train the agent on

344
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,195
certain training phrases that

345
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,575
might come up in
the conversations.

346
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,695
And, you know,

347
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,275
the Google dial dialogue flow

348
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,875
is pretty mature in terms of

349
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,594
natural language
processing, you know,

350
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:18,754
they have, machine learning

351
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:19,218
model capability,

352
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,420
training capabilities
already built in.

353
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:21,940
they already have,

354
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,030
types that are
system defined.

355
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,890
So, they know things like age

356
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,870
and gender.

357
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:33,995
We don't need to tell,

358
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,235
the framework about
these concepts.

359
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,155
But for our specific problem,

360
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:41,675
we had to train
the agent on our

361
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:43,675
concepts the main
concepts from

362
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:44,735
our domain ontology,

363
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,030
the ACs and social determinant

364
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,930
of health ontology.

365
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,950
And so we need to
define entity types.

366
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,390
We need to load the agent with

367
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,610
those entity types,

368
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,670
and we need to
train it on certain

369
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,170
phrases.

370
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,590
And, so I'm going
to talk about

371
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,765
all of this next.

372
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:04,145
the first step, you know,

373
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,985
training the chatbot on those

374
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,665
domain content concepts.

375
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:10,145
As I said, Google
utilizes natural

376
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:11,505
language processing
to do that.

377
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:13,905
But, if let's say this is one

378
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:16,005
of the scenarios
that came up and,

379
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,570
you know, and was inspired by

380
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,970
the quarterly
reports of the Fry

381
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,070
initiative. So,
within this sentence,

382
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,650
it's, you know, it's a text,

383
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,090
but there are certain concepts

384
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,530
that we wanted the agent to be

385
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,430
able to detect.

386
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:33,515
And so whenever, you know,

387
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,275
whenever the agent
sees the word

388
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:37,035
alcoholic, it
should be detected

389
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,415
as a substance abuse.

390
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,075
So this is an entity type,

391
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,335
and alcoholic is
a parameter value.

392
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:44,315
And that's so
that's that appears

393
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:45,755
in the current
conversation and

394
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:46,735
the current context.

395
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,980
And so,

396
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,340
the the we told we
told the framework

397
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,320
that this is,

398
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,120
a concept based
on our ontology.

399
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,440
So our ontology
covers that concept.

400
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,135
same thing, calm, you know,

401
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,215
I can't calm my child down.

402
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,615
He bounces back.
This is a symptom.

403
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:06,515
These are symptoms.

404
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,675
So anything in brown
is a symptom.

405
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,375
four year old as a phrase,

406
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,295
this is detected by Google as

407
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,055
a as an age. So that's why we

408
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,260
see that it says, prefix.

409
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,540
It's like a system.
sex, the same thing.

410
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,980
So there are
things that Google

411
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,940
is able to detect,

412
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,860
and that makes it
easier for us.

413
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,260
But, substance
abuse, symptom,

414
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,160
these are things.

415
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:31,305
stress is a is
an outcome is a negative

416
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:31,945
health outcome.

417
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:32,905
It's not a disease,

418
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,505
but it's a negative
health outcome,

419
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,285
and that is encoded
in the ontology.

420
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:39,245
So that's about the training.

421
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,880
now about
the the other important

422
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,880
aspect in developing chatbots

423
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,640
is this thing called intent.

424
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,100
So, for example,
within an agent,

425
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,940
within an application
domain, if,

426
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,780
let's say,
the person is talking

427
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,580
about a problem,

428
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,215
I would like to
be able to keep

429
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:59,015
track of what
their context is,

430
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,935
and I want to keep
all of the active

431
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,055
context on a stack.

432
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:05,095
So if they say I have
housing issues,

433
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,830
then, housing it
looks like this

434
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,990
person is looking
for a housing

435
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,330
recommendation.
And so in general,

436
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,810
this is an FRI or
family resilience

437
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,850
initiative
recommendation intent,

438
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,470
but this the the child intent

439
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,005
or the specific intent within

440
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,165
that generic intent
is a housing

441
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,705
recommendation.
He's not looking

442
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,525
she's not looking for,

443
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:28,825
food insecurities.

444
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,405
She's looking for housing

445
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:30,905
recommendations.

446
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,045
So that's there's this concept

447
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,560
of parent child
intent detection.

448
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,400
And, as I said,

449
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,260
each at each point in
the conversation,

450
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,800
there is one, you know, one,

451
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,335
one intent we're
working with,

452
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:47,935
but we want we want to keep

453
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:50,095
track of all
historical intents

454
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:51,295
that have been detected.

455
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,955
And so we call these
active contacts.

456
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:56,015
So Google data
flow keeps track

457
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:56,675
of those.

458
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,935
and but, of course,

459
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:01,740
we have we must have defined

460
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,180
those at the beginning, but,

461
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
it it keeps detecting
the intents

462
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,120
at each step in
the conversation.

463
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,240
So, in addition to detecting

464
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,140
intents and keeping
them on a stack

465
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,280
of active contexts,

466
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,205
the the agent should detect as

467
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,905
we said the contextual
parameters.

468
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:22,045
And so, you know,

469
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,165
three eight one zero three is

470
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,025
a ZIP code, so that's a system

471
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,405
system type. twenty one years

472
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,265
old is an age that's
a system type.

473
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:32,180
But housing circumstance,
you know,

474
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,520
is an entity type in
this conversation,

475
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,180
so that's detected
as an entity type.

476
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,140
And the parameters are we have

477
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,460
three parameters that
have that type.

478
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,600
So we have mold.

479
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,305
She suffers from
housing issues.

480
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,625
In particular, she
has mold, bugs,

481
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,005
and inadequate heating.

482
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,325
Again, so
housing circumstances

483
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,565
is a type defined
in our ontology.

484
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,405
And so, the intent detection,

485
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,490
active context, and
context parameters,

486
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,750
and their entity types.

487
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,970
All of that is,

488
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,370
is the is is kept track of.

489
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,530
And going forward in
the conversation,

490
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,990
if, let's say, we
reached a stage

491
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,430
where we are ready to schedule

492
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,585
an appointment,
then we have to,

493
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,165
we ask the person,

494
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:18,365
would you like me to schedule

495
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:18,925
an appointment?

496
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:21,085
And if they say
yes, I start an,

497
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:23,185
you know, an action
or an event.

498
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,365
And so I have to
call, you know,

499
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:28,620
the the the intent that is

500
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,320
responsible for that action.

501
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,260
And for that purpose,
I need the time.

502
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,180
I need the the appointment
type.

503
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,880
Is it a psychological
appointment?

504
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,460
Is it a clinical appointment?

505
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,860
I need the date
and time and for

506
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,575
how long. And so,

507
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:44,815
there is something
called the slot

508
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,995
filling, context.

509
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:50,355
And, in in
conversation agents,

510
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:52,195
we you know, in in
these platforms,

511
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:55,360
you we can we can
say that these

512
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,800
are the mandatory parameters.

513
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,100
These are optional
parameters.

514
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
You know, they
can the the user

515
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,680
can skip some of them and but

516
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,720
some of them are important.

517
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
And for the for those that are

518
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,860
important for
the appointment,

519
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,235
we can link them to
friendly questions.

520
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,335
For example, we can say,

521
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:11,855
can you please provide
me with a date?

522
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:13,615
Can you please provide
me with a time?

523
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,695
So that's something
we can work

524
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,075
with through those platforms.

525
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,175
But I'm just showing
the, you know,

526
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:22,435
the technical, aspects,

527
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,930
behind the scenes,

528
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,450
what happens behind
the scenes.

529
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,450
So to the left is what
a user would see,

530
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,470
and to the right
is what happens

531
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,790
within the dialogue
flow framework.

532
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,085
the third, thing,

533
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:36,385
and that's very important,

534
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:39,085
is how how do we
lay all of this

535
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,245
information over
to our, you know,

536
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,265
recommendation or
knowledge graph,

537
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,205
you know, generation
service or,

538
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:49,100
you know, back end
component is through,

539
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,920
again, this is done through

540
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,160
the Google Cloud
platform through

541
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,380
something called
fulfillments.

542
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,500
And so, a fulfillment
is simply,

543
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,640
you know, it's it's
like a service

544
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,080
that could be either
user defined.

545
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,860
So we could define our own

546
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,555
recommendation service
endpoint and,

547
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:07,595
you know, for those who use

548
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,035
Google Cloud
platform that you're

549
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:09,995
probably familiar with this.

550
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,515
So we have to define our own

551
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:12,815
service and what it does,

552
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:14,955
but we can also
utilize the Google

553
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,175
Cloud platform APIs.

554
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,570
and that's one of the reasons

555
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,770
why I chose this platform.

556
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,130
For example, if I
want to schedule

557
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:21,770
an appointment,

558
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,470
I could invoke
the Google Calendar

559
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,610
API and do the you know,

560
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,310
I I could trigger the calendar

561
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,930
app on the user side
and, you know,

562
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,610
they can just
automatically add

563
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,270
the appointment.

564
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,375
I can involve
the Google Places

565
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,395
API if I want to
look for clinics

566
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,715
around. So I don't
have to redefine.

567
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:40,455
I don't have to
reinvent the wheel.

568
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,775
I can use existing APIs.

569
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:44,215
And so that's simply,

570
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,495
that's what fulfillment does.

571
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,700
So it's like an intermediary,

572
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,820
component there
for communication

573
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,220
between the chatbot
and whatever

574
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,960
other services I would like to

575
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,200
use such as Neo four
g and, you know,

576
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,260
those other components.

577
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:02,185
And so that's for the agent or

578
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,625
the chatbot. Now,

579
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:04,765
through the fulfillment,

580
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:07,785
we pass over
the parameters and

581
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,465
their entity types
to the knowledge

582
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:12,185
graph. So now we have data in

583
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,960
terms of values, and
we have, you know,

584
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,040
context in terms of
those entity types.

585
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,820
So we have concepts and data.

586
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,680
And so we would
like to do to,

587
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360
you know, to to build a graph

588
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
that is personalized to this

589
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800
specific user,
and we would like

590
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,155
to enrich that graph gradually

591
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,535
and populate it with values or

592
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:32,675
facts or data,

593
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:35,615
that the user did
not even mention

594
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:36,355
in the conversation.

595
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:37,535
And for that purpose,

596
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,375
we used we collect evidence,

597
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,515
as I mentioned earlier,

598
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,015
through this observatory or

599
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:44,000
through publicly
available research,

600
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,780
articles. And so I would like

601
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,300
to talk more about
this knowledge

602
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,120
graph component.

603
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,460
So, as I said, we you know,

604
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,600
within this conversation,

605
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,360
if the person said,
I am Hispanic,

606
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,065
female living in
Memphis in this

607
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,465
ZIP code. My six
year old child

608
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,005
experiences night terror.

609
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:05,505
I don't have a car.

610
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,465
If she mentions
those, you know,

611
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,225
those words in
the text that she

612
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,825
provides in the in the chat,

613
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:12,645
in the conversation,

614
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,180
I can start off with
those concepts.

615
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,760
So I can start with those by

616
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,400
adding you know,

617
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,780
I can create a personalized

618
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,920
graph for her. So I start by

619
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,220
adding those parameters,

620
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,860
contextual parameters
in purple.

621
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:29,765
So all these circles,

622
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,205
Hispanic three eight
one zero three.

623
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,205
So these are things
that, you know,

624
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:35,605
she mentioned.
And then I start

625
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,705
linking those parameter values

626
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,225
to their entity types
based on concepts,

627
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,770
you know, either common sense

628
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,610
concepts or
concepts defined in

629
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,850
my anthology. And so,

630
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,750
Hispanic is a race,
so that's,

631
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,210
you know, it's the value is

632
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,670
Hispanic and it's a race.

633
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,170
And three eight one zero three

634
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,690
is a ZIP code, and,

635
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,105
six years old is
in this context

636
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,745
is an age, and,

637
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:06,985
night terror is a symptom.

638
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:08,825
So symptom here is an example

639
00:22:08,825 --> 00:22:10,825
of a concept that is
not common sense.

640
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:13,300
It's something
that I we define

641
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,240
in the anthologies,

642
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,140
and so it's that's
why it's in blue.

643
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,420
So that's something that we

644
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,260
detected in
the conversation as

645
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,320
an entity type.

646
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,700
Now the next step is to start

647
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
populating the graph with more

648
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,665
and more nodes based on this,

649
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,445
concept hierarchy hierarchical

650
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:33,565
relationships, you know,

651
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:36,125
those object
properties defined

652
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:36,845
in the ontology.

653
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:37,745
So for example,

654
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,645
three eight one zero three as

655
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:41,585
a ZIP code represents
a neighborhood.

656
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:42,865
So that's a neighborhood,

657
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,190
And a neighborhood has,

658
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,170
I'm just gonna to
be able to point.

659
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,770
So this is a neighborhood,

660
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,630
and a neighborhood
has physical

661
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,610
characteristics. And physical

662
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,310
characteristics
could be workability

663
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,265
scores, crime rate,

664
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,485
and blight prevalence,
you know,

665
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:02,425
signs of destruction
in the neighborhood

666
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:03,685
. And so,

667
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,725
I can add more and more edges

668
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:09,125
and notes based on what I can

669
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,120
infer from
the the the anthology.

670
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,400
And another example
is that six

671
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,860
as an age is a school age.

672
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,720
She did not say that
in the conversation

673
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,840
, but I can I can
enrich the graph

674
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,495
by adding that external and

675
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:26,155
the relationship?

676
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,715
And so these are just
simple examples,

677
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,535
but this is an example of how

678
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,535
I how I infer extra knowledge

679
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:34,315
to enrich and
refine the graph.

680
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,530
and the last step is I start

681
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,090
populating those
notes with values.

682
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,150
So, for example,

683
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,370
how do I know that three eight

684
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,970
one zero three
what is the value

685
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,490
for a workability
score in three

686
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,550
eight one zero three?

687
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,045
It's from this pop population

688
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,945
observatory that
we're building.

689
00:23:51,945 --> 00:23:55,625
So we have, data
for, you know,

690
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,505
for each ZIP code.

691
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:59,145
I can retrieve all of these

692
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,065
characteristics,
community level

693
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,765
characteristics
publicly available

694
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,210
to populate the graph
with values

695
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,030
or facts.

696
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,630
and, so that's what,

697
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,250
the graph is gonna look like

698
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,250
after a while. And as I said,

699
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,915
each node is color coded based

700
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,175
on where we get
those nodes from,

701
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:21,255
and the edges could be direct

702
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:22,995
because they were mentioned or

703
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,835
in you know, they could be

704
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:26,695
indirect because
they were inferred.

705
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:30,510
And, so that's,

706
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,650
and I'm gonna go back to this

707
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,550
later on for,
explaining more things.

708
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,730
Now, once we're done
with the knowledge

709
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,630
graph generation,

710
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,210
now we it's time to start

711
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,190
providing recommendations.

712
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:44,545
So for this
particular scenario

713
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:45,285
and application,

714
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:47,505
we we thought of two kinds of

715
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,345
recommendations. So one one

716
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:51,265
thing is what is you know,

717
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:53,525
based on all of those
detected issues,

718
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:56,310
what is the next question that

719
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,030
the QA agent should
be asking the user?

720
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,490
So what's the next follow-up

721
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,550
question that is
relevant to this user?

722
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,230
We don't want to
overwhelm them

723
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,450
with a lot of questions.

724
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,450
What is the most recommended

725
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,050
questions to ask next?

726
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,945
Or if we are more
towards the end

727
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:13,465
of the conversation
and we know

728
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:15,785
that we what
the person is mostly

729
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:16,425
concerned about,

730
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:17,805
we could recommend resources,

731
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:21,165
so clinics, appointments,
and and so on.

732
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:24,860
And, we also would
like to provide

733
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,220
explanations. So
we want to keep

734
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,080
track of how we made
the recommendation,

735
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,140
and that's also
done on the graph.

736
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,420
So I'm just gonna talk about

737
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,400
this specific part next.

738
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,320
So in terms of personalized

739
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,820
recommendations,
I'm just gonna

740
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,805
go back to this graph that I

741
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:40,525
showed earlier,

742
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:41,885
and I'm showing the right side

743
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:43,665
of the graph just
for clarity.

744
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,925
So this person
said that her six

745
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:49,425
year old child has
night terrors.

746
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,005
And so as I said,

747
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,900
we had populated
the graph with

748
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,760
the fact that six is an age,

749
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,440
and it's a school age.

750
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,180
So one question that comes up

751
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,100
in AC's questionnaires is,

752
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,420
does your child suffer from

753
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,560
bullying at school?

754
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,775
If I know that six
is a school age,

755
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,615
then I should ask
this question next.

756
00:26:08,615 --> 00:26:11,575
If not, I should
just skip it.

757
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:13,735
And that's one
example of I how

758
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:16,235
I can refine the questions.

759
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:20,610
another example is, you know,

760
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,150
this thing about uncovering

761
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,730
hidden issues. For example,

762
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,930
she said night terror.

763
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,370
Night terror is
a symptom based

764
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,190
on my ontology.

765
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,210
But I know from
my ontology that

766
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,050
night terror as a symptom is

767
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,830
caused by emotional neglect.

768
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,565
This is something I
encoded both as,

769
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:38,625
you know, a concept,

770
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,625
and I encoded
the relationship,

771
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:42,545
so the causality
relationship.

772
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:45,185
So emotional neglect causes

773
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:47,350
night terror. Now I'm not sure

774
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,590
if this user if
this is the case

775
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,310
with this user,

776
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,230
but I would like
to ask her that

777
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,570
question next. So
I might ask her,

778
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,990
does your child suffer
from, you know,

779
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,875
emotional neglect?

780
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,715
Or I could bring it
up in a different

781
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:02,155
way. One of the questions that

782
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:03,995
comes up in
the questionnaire is,

783
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:06,075
have you recently
separated from

784
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:06,815
your husband?

785
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:09,115
So I could ask it
in a, you know,

786
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:10,495
in a more friendly way.

787
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:12,875
And, if she says yes,

788
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,400
we can follow-up
on that question.

789
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,560
If she say says no,
we can move to the,

790
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,100
you know, to the to the next,

791
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,880
next stage where we can start

792
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,660
suggesting
psychiatry clinics.

793
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
And, so I can ask her,

794
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,760
would you like so now this is

795
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,400
not a question.

796
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,380
This is a resource.

797
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:32,945
So I ask her, would
you like, here are,

798
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,385
you know, a couple
of psychiatric

799
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:37,045
clinics within and I
can't personalize.

800
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,545
So I can say this is these are

801
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,805
the clinics within
your ZIP code area,

802
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:42,805
and they also have a Spanish

803
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,625
speaking services, you know,

804
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,840
based on the fact that she

805
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,940
provided those two
context the contextual

806
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,000
parameters about ZIP code and

807
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,380
the fact that she's Hispanic.

808
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,600
So this is an example
of how how

809
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,900
I can personalize
and how a suggestion

810
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,960
can be either a resource
or a follow-up

811
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,845
question. Now the other aspect

812
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:03,725
is explanations.

813
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,905
So, this is now the left side

814
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:08,605
of the graph for clarity.

815
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,585
So this is the same person who

816
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:12,665
was talking. Now
she did not say

817
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,125
anything about
social determinants

818
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,690
of of health. All what she was

819
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,610
talking about was related to

820
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,990
adverse childhood experiences

821
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,250
and behavioral issues.

822
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,490
But the fact that she lives in

823
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,010
three zero two e
three eight one

824
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,130
zero three can
give me a lot of

825
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,890
information just based on her

826
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:29,390
neighborhood.

827
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,305
I can do a lot here.

828
00:28:31,365 --> 00:28:33,765
I can as I said
earlier, I can say,

829
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,125
well, this is a ZIP code that

830
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,045
presents a neighborhood that

831
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:39,605
suffers from this
much crime rate,

832
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:42,005
this much destruction in terms

833
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:43,305
of neighborhood quality,

834
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:45,970
and it has this
walkability score.

835
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,810
And I can populate
those with values.

836
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,690
And if if, let's
say, you know,

837
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,630
blight is the highest,
then I can say,

838
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,705
well, you know,

839
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:59,625
she might be living she might

840
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,385
be one of one of
the aspects of

841
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:03,465
measuring blight
rate or, you know,

842
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:06,505
this, neighborhood
quality aspect

843
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:08,745
is something called lead lead

844
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:11,890
paint based exposure
risk score.

845
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,510
And, so they
calculate the score

846
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,950
based on several things.

847
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,710
One of them is that that she's

848
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,810
living in a house
that might be

849
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,270
might be painted with a lead

850
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,505
based paint, and that could

851
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:25,965
expose her to toxicants.

852
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:28,445
And the exposure to toxicants

853
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,425
might cause a negative health

854
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:31,545
outcomes like asthma.

855
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:34,185
And so I could do all of this

856
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:36,460
behind the scenes
and then give

857
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,980
her a follow-up question that

858
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,280
she did not even was
not even aware of.

859
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,000
I could ask her,
would you you know,

860
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,740
does anybody in your household

861
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,960
suffer from asthma?

862
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,440
And if she says yes,
I can directly,

863
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,845
give her resource suggestions

864
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:53,925
of asthma clinics.

865
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,605
If the if if it's her child,

866
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:56,985
then I can suggest pediatric

867
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:57,945
asthma clinics.

868
00:29:58,085 --> 00:29:59,125
And I can, again,

869
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,365
personalize based on her ZIP

870
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,465
code and her, ethnicity.

871
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:06,100
And, you know,

872
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,700
I can trace I can
trace back on this.

873
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,140
So this is an example
of something

874
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,020
she did not mention,

875
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
and I want to show the person

876
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,700
behind the chat who's talking

877
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,100
to the user why I came up with

878
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,185
all of this. So
I can trace back

879
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,945
on the graph and come up with

880
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,225
this path of reasoning of why

881
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:26,845
I made you know,

882
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,425
I suggested for
the health care

883
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:30,125
practitioner to
ask that question

884
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:32,045
or suggest those resources.

885
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,420
And so I can this is this is

886
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,700
the the beauty of graphs.

887
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,620
I can always
provide the path.

888
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,460
It's it's it's
it's white box.

889
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,760
It's not black box.

890
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,940
And so in in going forward to

891
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,240
developing the tool,

892
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,485
we wanted a tool design that

893
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:50,445
reflects all of this.

894
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:53,265
So, yes, we want
this chat box,

895
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,945
chatbot to be available
to the end user.

896
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:58,765
In this case, it's the child

897
00:30:58,765 --> 00:30:59,985
parent or the caregiver,

898
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,190
but we also wanted to provide

899
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,010
all of these
recommendations to

900
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,690
the health care
practitioner or

901
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,710
social worker depending
on the domain.

902
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,210
And we want also to
provide, you know,

903
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,370
policymakers with
explanations and,

904
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,830
you know, aggregated
analytics.

905
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,445
And so before even thinking of

906
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:18,425
the tool design,

907
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,105
this is just a prototype.

908
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:22,405
So before thinking
about the design,

909
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:24,405
we wanted to see what
we want to show.

910
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:26,025
And so, eventually,

911
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:27,625
we want to
provide recommendations

912
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:29,605
in in in the health domain.

913
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:30,665
They call them interventions,

914
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,330
which could be
either therapeutic

915
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,370
or preventive.

916
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,390
And, things like, you know,

917
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,910
schedule an appointment with

918
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,670
an asthma clinic
pediatric asthma

919
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,610
clinic. This is a this
is an intervention

920
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,250
. And we when we personalize,

921
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:46,565
we give preferences.

922
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,865
So we say
the preferences is we

923
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,305
want this to be near the ZIP

924
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:52,645
code with this language
speaking skills.

925
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:54,725
And then we want to,

926
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:57,425
be keep track of
everything that

927
00:31:57,425 --> 00:31:58,650
we detected in
the conversation.

928
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,010
Symptoms are important.

929
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,930
So we want to keep
track of those from,

930
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,310
you know, a health
perspective,

931
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,090
and we want to detect
risk factors.

932
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,770
Again, risk factors
is a, you know,

933
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,630
is a is a concept
used in the medical

934
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,190
field.

935
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,870
So risk factors,

936
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,045
that appeared in this woman's

937
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,525
conversations where
things like blights,

938
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:21,065
you know, being living
in a neighborhood

939
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,525
with a high plight rating,

940
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:25,380
this is a social
determinant of health.

941
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,640
Night terror as a symptom

942
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,960
represents a behavioral issue

943
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,020
that is related to adverse

944
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,640
childhood experiences because

945
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,300
we wanted this tool to also be

946
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,340
a surveillance tool.

947
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,000
So we want to keep
track of symptoms,

948
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,775
risk factors,
and also what are

949
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:43,055
the negative health outcomes

950
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:44,835
that we inferred in
this conversation.

951
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,675
Asthma was one of them.

952
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,375
and then we want to provide

953
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,455
explanations. And in providing

954
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:53,075
explanation, we
want to provide

955
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:54,275
the source of evidence,

956
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,060
how we came up with
this explanation.

957
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,580
And so we want to say
that the neighborhood

958
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,400
with blights, you know,

959
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,480
coming up with this was based

960
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,860
on the ontological reasoning,

961
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,660
but we came up with
applied value,

962
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,425
the the rating white rating

963
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,665
value from this
observatory that

964
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:14,765
we collected from population

965
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:15,965
level datasets.

966
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:18,345
So we want to
provide the source

967
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,865
of evidence, and we want them

968
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,705
to be able to
navigate and look

969
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:24,285
into those, you
know, numbers.

970
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,910
And when we said
that lead exposure,

971
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,250
leads to asthma or
causes asthma,

972
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,570
that's something
we came up from

973
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,710
based on the ontology.

974
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,170
And so we we will we want to

975
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,610
provide them with
a link to this

976
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,695
ontology, and
they can actually

977
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:41,295
look at it depending on their

978
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:42,975
literacy level
and how much they

979
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:43,635
are interested.

980
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,355
But we need for this
to be available.

981
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:50,675
And, we also want
to, explain,

982
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:52,640
you know so in addition to

983
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,840
detecting health outcomes,

984
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
we detected a cause
of a symptom.

985
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,620
We detected that
emotional neglect

986
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,820
causes, night terror and,

987
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,155
both asthma and
emotional neglect

988
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:06,155
were detected based
on inference.

989
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:07,195
So they were not given.

990
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:08,175
They were inferred.

991
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:11,915
And in explaining this
part, we can say,

992
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:14,575
well, this based
on this causal

993
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,155
relationship between emotional

994
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,515
neglect and night terror,

995
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:20,230
and the resource for evidence

996
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,110
is the ontology.

997
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,370
And so the, the last thing I

998
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,530
wanna talk about
is the the tool

999
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,730
design that we thought of,

1000
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,110
and it's really preliminary,

1001
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,410
and we're working
on, you know,

1002
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,010
refining and revising it.

1003
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,785
But the the there
are two views

1004
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:36,725
of this tool.

1005
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:39,525
The first view is
which provides,

1006
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:40,505
you know, the recommendations

1007
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:44,325
and the explainability
and the detection

1008
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:47,190
of social determinants,
risk factors,

1009
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,890
ACs, and all of that, and,

1010
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,230
the analytics, the aggregated

1011
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,290
analytics based
on all previous

1012
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,770
conversations,
that is something

1013
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,530
that we would like the health

1014
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,310
care professional
or the policymaker

1015
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,435
to look at. And,

1016
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,835
example of explanations,
as I said.

1017
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,095
so for example here, the,

1018
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:13,395
the health care
practitioner can,

1019
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,710
For example, when we said that

1020
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,410
the this patient
has the following,

1021
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,990
risk, you know, symptoms,

1022
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,890
the risk factors,

1023
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,210
exposure to lead based pains,

1024
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,650
that a patient has
a certain risk score,

1025
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,030
and, the fact that they should

1026
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,330
be screened for asthma.

1027
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,725
So all of that is you know,

1028
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:32,625
these are suggestions.

1029
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,445
But if they want
to explain this,

1030
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,365
they can click on
a question mark,

1031
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,845
you know, to
explain why we made

1032
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:42,285
these decisions, and,
we can, you know,

1033
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:44,740
show them a pop up or, like,

1034
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,260
a different view
where they can

1035
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,500
see why we made this.

1036
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,340
So one way of explaining this

1037
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,120
is based on semantic
inference,

1038
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,660
and we can provide a brief

1039
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,325
description of, you know,

1040
00:35:56,325 --> 00:35:57,925
the causal relationship and

1041
00:35:57,925 --> 00:35:59,525
the link to
the ontology if they

1042
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,645
would like to look at it.

1043
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:04,025
And, if let's say
this conversation

1044
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:08,325
detected four behavioral
aspects about,

1045
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:10,560
you know, that this
child suffers from,

1046
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,160
then we can give
them an adverse

1047
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,800
childhood experience
score four

1048
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,500
because there were there were

1049
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,860
four answers.

1050
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,560
You know? We asked them four

1051
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,620
follow-up questions,

1052
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,520
and they said yes
to all four,

1053
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,065
then we can give
them this score.

1054
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:26,205
And if, you know,

1055
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:29,065
they can decide
if this is a is

1056
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:31,385
a high score or a low score or

1057
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:32,665
what they should do based on

1058
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:34,345
the score based on
the literature.

1059
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:37,005
So we can give
them article DOIs

1060
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:38,845
so they can pull up articles,

1061
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,350
authentic articles
about AEs and

1062
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,170
health outcomes.

1063
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,870
so this is
an example of how we

1064
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,770
provide explanations.

1065
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,470
And as I said, you know,

1066
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,770
we can provide geocoded,

1067
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,510
since this is a tool,

1068
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,730
we can provide geocoded,

1069
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,235
resource suggestions
of clinics

1070
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:58,475
or housing authorities within

1071
00:36:58,695 --> 00:36:59,815
their ZIP code,

1072
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,835
and we can show it on a map.

1073
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:05,735
and, for the the end user or

1074
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:08,155
the the the caregiver,
we can give them,

1075
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,640
you know, we can load these

1076
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,900
suggestions into
the chat box,

1077
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
and we can either do this

1078
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
automatically or
give the health

1079
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
care practitioner
the option to,

1080
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,895
you know, approve that this is

1081
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:22,335
the next question or not.

1082
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:23,295
Because this is, you know,

1083
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,635
this is something that
needs evaluation.

1084
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,255
So we can we can try this with

1085
00:37:28,255 --> 00:37:30,515
a few scenarios and
see what works best.

1086
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:34,270
But, this is
an example of what

1087
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,030
I was talking about earlier of

1088
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,710
the power of the Google Cloud

1089
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,970
Platform APIs through
fulfillment.

1090
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,590
So we can integrate
Google Maps

1091
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,450
or Google Places in
the conversation.

1092
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,270
We can integrate
Google Calendar

1093
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,090
in the conversations,

1094
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,125
in order to provide those

1095
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,365
recommendations. And so we're

1096
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:54,425
working on,

1097
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:57,045
evaluating this and trying to

1098
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,605
bring it to realization with

1099
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:00,905
the Afarai initiative,

1100
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:03,305
team at La Bonner.

1101
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,840
And, we're looking
to, you know,

1102
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,080
get, funding for actually

1103
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,860
implementing the entire tool,

1104
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,620
and and integrated in clinical

1105
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,735
workflows. thank
you so much for

1106
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,335
listening, and this is the end

1107
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:21,075
of my presentation.
