1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello. good morning.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
Well, at least
good morning here

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,340
in California.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,280
my name is Jens Asman,

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,220
and I'm the CEO
of France Inc.

6
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:15,775
And our core product that most

7
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:18,335
of you know about
is is a knowledge

8
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:19,795
graph tool called
AllegoGraph.

9
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,295
and today, I'm going to talk

10
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:25,955
about the last
fetched stitches

11
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:28,575
of dark data. So
for a long time,

12
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:30,320
well, most of the people in

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
the audience know
what dark data is.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,120
It's a for a long time,

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
it was just all
the unstructured text,

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,900
but there's actually
even a bigger

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
pool of dark data
in the enterprise,

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,020
and that is
spoken conversations

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,400
between customers and company

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,775
representatives.
And so today,

21
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,295
I'm going to talk
about how you

22
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:50,075
can combine speech technology

23
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,135
with knowledge
graphs and about

24
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,655
some of the things
that we learned

25
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:54,935
in the last four years that

26
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,755
we've been deep into,
speech technology,

27
00:00:57,895 --> 00:00:59,355
NLP, and knowledge graphs.

28
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,190
So, personally,

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,330
I worked in the early
late nineties,

30
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,930
in the early two thousands in

31
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,390
the at the the Dutch,
telecom lab,

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,370
and we were doing or we were

33
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,970
working on early versions of

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,735
Siri and early
versions of iPads,

35
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:19,055
and I was writing
articles about how,

36
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,335
for example, on an iPad,

37
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:22,895
you could use speech input to

38
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:24,835
write your emails and then use

39
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:27,535
your pen to correct
the mistakes

40
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,855
that you made. and
we were looking

41
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,730
at systems like Siri where we

42
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,090
had a combination of human

43
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,130
assistance and,

44
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,210
and and and speech and and

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,230
assistance done by
speech technology.

46
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,230
And it was wonderful,

47
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,970
wonderful world at work,

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,505
but I was kind of
always a little

49
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,105
bit hesitant,
and I never could

50
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,585
believe that this
could come to a real,

51
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:50,025
real systems. Yeah.

52
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:52,125
So and even in two
thousand fourteen,

53
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,345
that there were articles like

54
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:57,785
this where people
would say, well,

55
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,685
it's peace recognition,

56
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:01,320
the unreachable frontier.

57
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
And here's an article by James

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,760
Kendrick that says voice input

59
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
has been a pipe
dream since Star

60
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,280
Trek with crew members talking

61
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,660
into the air and the computers

62
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,900
understanding every
spoken word word.

63
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,025
And he claims
speech technology

64
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,465
can only do ninety
five percent,

65
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:17,325
which I think he
still was high.

66
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:19,705
But be that as it may,

67
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,585
my company my my
customers are really,

68
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:24,265
really happy with
ninety five percent.

69
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,765
Yeah? Because, I mean,
until recently,

70
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,500
they had all that dark data,

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,800
all these spoken
conversations,

72
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,380
and they couldn't do
anything with it.

73
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,540
But ninety five
percent is ninety

74
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,460
five percent more
than they ever

75
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,560
could do before, even
infinitely more.

76
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,460
So what I'm gonna talk about

77
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,765
today is what text
analytics, NLP,

78
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:43,785
knowledge graphs,

79
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,545
and speech technology
can do for

80
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,005
your enterprise or
your enterprise

81
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:48,445
customer. Right?

82
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:50,525
And so, of course,

83
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,025
a lot of you guys will be in,

84
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:54,285
the area of NLP and
text analytics,

85
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,230
and it's a booming
market. Yeah.

86
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,990
So they expect in two thousand

87
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,390
twenty four, text analytics is

88
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,330
already close to a nine
billion dollar,

89
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,430
industry, but
speech is growing

90
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,310
even faster.

91
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,730
Yeah. I mean,
analytics insights

92
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,085
estimates that in two thousand

93
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,185
twenty five, the recognition

94
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:14,925
the voice recognition market

95
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,525
will be close to thirty one

96
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,905
billion dollars. Yeah.

97
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,685
And speech technology
is becoming

98
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:21,885
part of everyday life.

99
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,325
I I never would have imagined

100
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:24,365
that we've got to that point,

101
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,130
but we have now gotten
to that point.

102
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,090
I I'm a big, big fan of,

103
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,650
of Google Voice technology and

104
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,710
their Google Assistant.

105
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,290
I never ever type
an a text message.

106
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,110
I only always will say
my text messages.

107
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:43,825
I think it's Google
is better than Siri,

108
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,605
but people might
disagree, obviously.

109
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:46,945
And then, of course,

110
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,305
a lot of you guys will already

111
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,505
have an Alexa in your home,

112
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,445
or you will use
Cortana or Windows,

113
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,030
or you will use something
that IBM made,

114
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,610
but it's become part
of everyday life.

115
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,470
Yeah? And it's not only that

116
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,110
these big companies
create those

117
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,470
technologies, but they also

118
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,235
provide APIs to it. Yeah.

119
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,915
So here's a two
thousand eighteen

120
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,295
comparison where they look at

121
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,515
what Amazon, Google, IBM,

122
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:11,895
and all the others are doing.

123
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,215
And, I'll leave it
in my presentation.

124
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,975
But what you actually can see

125
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:17,495
is that even now,

126
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,230
the speech to text is good.

127
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,670
It's never get to the point

128
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,350
where speech to
text is excellent.

129
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,030
So we have for Amazon,

130
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,230
speech to text is good.

131
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,470
For Google, speech to text is

132
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,290
is intermediate.

133
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,635
for IBM Watson, it's good.

134
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,195
So it's getting there,
yeah, these APIs.

135
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,415
and one of the big problems,

136
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:39,935
and I'm gonna talk
about it today,

137
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:41,855
is that you really need to be

138
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,075
able to customize,

139
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,500
for your if you wanna
create a service

140
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
based on speech technology,

141
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,700
you'll find that there's a lot

142
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,260
of domain words
that these speech

143
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,100
recognizers don't do yet.

144
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,220
I mean, they're getting better

145
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,940
at day over day,

146
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,695
but you need to be able to

147
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:58,335
customize them.

148
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,615
And that is where right now

149
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:01,295
the the the biggest problem is

150
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:02,595
with using these
technologies,

151
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,515
but I'll talk about
it today. Yeah.

152
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:08,015
And so say you're working for

153
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,775
a big enterprise or a big

154
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,795
enterprise is your
customer. Yeah.

155
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,750
What can you do with spoken,

156
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,450
conversations? Well,

157
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,030
if you look at what people now

158
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,870
do with NLP, it's
mostly focused

159
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,330
on regular text
and documents.

160
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,710
But, believe me,

161
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,390
practices for
text analytics on

162
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,230
documents cannot directly be

163
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,610
applied to spoken
conversations.

164
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,495
We find that normal human

165
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,355
conversations are
so informal,

166
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,535
yeah, that it just
it just won't work.

167
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,535
Yeah. So we had to work for

168
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:38,735
the last four years to,

169
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
to really see what
NLP techniques

170
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,860
we efficiently and effectively

171
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,580
could use for,
spoken combinations.

172
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
And so today, I
will discuss a use

173
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
case that we did or that we do

174
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,820
with an intelligent
call center.

175
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,905
The call center that
we work with is,

176
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,305
a company in Atlanta called n

177
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,645
three n three results.

178
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,445
they have about
fifteen hundred,

179
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,925
call center operators.

180
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:11,525
We call them BDRs.

181
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,890
Nearly all of
these people have

182
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,170
a college degree.

183
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,770
So it's an intelligent call

184
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,450
center and a high
end call center

185
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,690
in the sense that
they don't do

186
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,570
just simple scripts,
you know,

187
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,430
the people that call
you every day,

188
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:27,835
and in most cases,

189
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,435
just following
a a dumb script.

190
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:30,235
Now these people,

191
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,695
before they make
a phone call,

192
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,835
they first will
investigate the person,

193
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:34,495
the company,

194
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,355
and then only
then will they do

195
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,315
a a call.

196
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,175
So it's it's for the it's it's

197
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,410
more expensive,
but it's, yeah,

198
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,950
it's it's high end.

199
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,210
And in order to be
get better at this,

200
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,050
they have been
developing a lot of AI,

201
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,090
and we're happy that we could

202
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,910
help with that.

203
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,330
And so they got to the point

204
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,490
that then Accenture
took them over,

205
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,385
two months ago. Alright.

206
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:58,325
So this is the the call
center company,

207
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,085
that, we work for.

208
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:05,045
And so we have
a knowledge graph

209
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:06,625
for this call center company

210
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,060
that is mostly based on just,

211
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,820
structured data. Yeah.

212
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
So you have you wanna
build a knowledge

213
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,940
graph for your call center,

214
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,620
whether it's CRM
sales calls or

215
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,600
technical support.

216
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,020
I mean, what are
the things that

217
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,540
you wanna record and what you

218
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,740
can learn just by looking at

219
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,340
the structured
data in your CRM

220
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,475
databases and and,

221
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:25,555
all the other
systems that keep

222
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:26,915
track of what's
going on in your

223
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,195
call center. Well,

224
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,555
you wanna know what companies

225
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:31,155
and individuals did I talk to

226
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,755
before and who's
the best person

227
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:35,075
to talk to, and
what did I learn

228
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,515
about that company
or the person

229
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:37,290
in my call.

230
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,650
That's right. And
then your hope

231
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,430
that your people will
make good notes.

232
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,810
and is the person
that I talked

233
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,090
to still working
for that company?

234
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,470
Maybe you have to
go to LinkedIn.

235
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,050
Which of my salespeople made

236
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,490
the most sales and why?

237
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,945
What, or what sales agent is

238
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:53,565
more effective for
what technology

239
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,905
or what kind of
service, etcetera,

240
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,105
etcetera. So you can imagine

241
00:07:58,105 --> 00:07:59,965
there's a lot of
things that you can,

242
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,985
put in your knowledge graph to

243
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,800
make your sales
processes better.

244
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,920
And so here is a a picture of

245
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,860
a little part of
the knowledge graph.

246
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
we call it
the corporate memory

247
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,720
knowledge graph, yeah,

248
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
that can answer a lot
of the questions

249
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,135
that I just, showed
you in that slide.

250
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,955
And this is
a picture of Graph,

251
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,375
which is our,
visualization tool

252
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,215
on top of AllegoGraph.

253
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,995
And here you see that m three

254
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:29,055
might have a client,

255
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,875
like Rocket Cloud Services or

256
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,575
DigitalOcean Cloud Services.

257
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,150
And then when you
have a client,

258
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,370
you do multiple campaigns for

259
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,370
the same client or to focus on

260
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,110
one particular,

261
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,250
element that you wanna sell in

262
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,470
this particular campaign.

263
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,370
And then you will
have the sales

264
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,270
agents here that work
for a campaign,

265
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:49,885
but, obviously,

266
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,045
they work for
multiple campaigns,

267
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,785
and they have a start time and

268
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,965
an end time. So we we kind of

269
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:58,025
know when people
started working

270
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,065
for the campaign and when they

271
00:08:59,065 --> 00:08:59,885
stopped working.

272
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:00,985
And then on the other end,

273
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,185
you have the customers
that you

274
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:02,825
try to call.

275
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,390
You have, just for fun,

276
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,410
CVS Oakland or Acme Bread.

277
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,230
And then you have
contact people

278
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,750
that initially worked for this

279
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,110
company here and now work for

280
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,170
this company here.

281
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,550
we know a little bit
about the company

282
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,145
and what they sell and what

283
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:18,705
technology they
already have. Yeah.

284
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,645
And then there are the events

285
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:23,505
between the call center agents

286
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:24,705
and the customers.

287
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,545
Yeah. And these are
the core events,

288
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,905
the emails that get sent in

289
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:29,605
the forced calls. Right?

290
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,810
So you can imagine
this is a kind

291
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,730
of an impressionistic
view of,

292
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,270
our our knowledge graph.

293
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,530
But what we found
out that, okay,

294
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,050
there's already billions of

295
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,550
triples just in
the structured data,

296
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,545
but the real interesting data

297
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:45,905
is in the voice calls, yeah,

298
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:47,925
or in the emails between,

299
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:51,025
call center agents and contact

300
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,385
persons that work
for companies.

301
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,785
Yeah. So this is
where all the magic

302
00:09:54,785 --> 00:09:56,065
happens. So what
do you have to

303
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,020
do to get the interesting data

304
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,240
out of these voice calls?

305
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,040
Well, you need to do
speech technology.

306
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,840
Yeah.

307
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,740
And then once you do that,

308
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,080
what you really
want is to help

309
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
the call center
agents in real time.

310
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,740
Yeah. So there's this dream of

311
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,905
real time decision
support. Yeah.

312
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:13,725
For example,

313
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,825
where is a particular agent in

314
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,025
the sales cycle? Yeah.

315
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,645
Did she move
the process forward?

316
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:22,745
and and so one of the things

317
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:24,185
that you'll see several times

318
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:25,385
is the word bent,

319
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,250
which stands for
budget, authority,

320
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,390
need, and time line. Yeah.

321
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,810
So what you really
want is that

322
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,910
your sales agent
make sure that

323
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,150
before you hand
off a particular

324
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,510
customer that you talk to to

325
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,585
your big client
that will finalize

326
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,725
the sale, for example,

327
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,865
that you really know
that the person

328
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:47,865
you talk to has
a budget, yeah,

329
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:48,925
can make a decision,

330
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:50,925
actually said that
he needs something,

331
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:52,665
and knows when he needs it.

332
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,745
Right? Okay. So
that is just one

333
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,160
thing that that you can help

334
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
sales agents like, hey.

335
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
You didn't talk about
the budget there.

336
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,940
Please ask about that.

337
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Then and these are all common

338
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
sense things, but
should I correct

339
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,100
for open and
closed questions?

340
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,335
we find that
certain call center

341
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,255
agents talk way
more about product

342
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,615
categories,
whereas others talk

343
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:15,735
more about sellable products.

344
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:17,015
So we find that usually it's

345
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:18,215
better to talk about products

346
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:20,155
that you can
actually buy. Yeah?

347
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,455
Or how can you
help call center

348
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:24,160
agents when your
customer talks

349
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440
about a competitive product?

350
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
What you really want is when

351
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
this competitive product is

352
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
mentioned that you
provide a battle

353
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,600
card in real time.

354
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,520
Battle card is
a card that gives

355
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,120
you the main
arguments against,

356
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,220
your, well,
competitive product.

357
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,885
Or it's also very
important that

358
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,425
if you talk to a customer,

359
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:45,325
that you know in what
industry it is,

360
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:47,085
yeah, and what job title and

361
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,605
what his main use case is.

362
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,125
Again, if you
don't know that,

363
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,960
then your sales call
is kinda useless.

364
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,660
So you need to know
all these things.

365
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,500
So we help with that too.

366
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
And sometimes you
even wanna do

367
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,960
real time routing.

368
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,080
If you see that the customer

369
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,540
wants to know about
video conferencing,

370
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
well, maybe Joe
knows more about

371
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
it and just switch
while you're

372
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,955
in the call. Alright.

373
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,015
So these are just
part of the dream

374
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:09,535
of real time
decision support.

375
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:12,255
But then if you analyze
the voice calls,

376
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,795
you also can do
regular analytics

377
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,315
that you never
could do before.

378
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,235
Yeah. So for example,

379
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,030
what are the features and

380
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,150
functions that the customer

381
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,430
talks about the most? Yeah?

382
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,530
Or do we see that
there's momentum

383
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,930
for a particular
product that,

384
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,150
whether it's your own product

385
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,190
that you're trying to sell or

386
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,230
a competitor product?

387
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,990
Yeah? And if
the customer talks

388
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,645
about a particular
type of product,

389
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:34,625
what is the sentiment?

390
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,325
Or why is agent x so good at

391
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:38,925
selling product
y and way better

392
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,385
than any other of the agents?

393
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:43,325
and, again, there's
a lot of analytics,

394
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,350
and this is just
a few of the tens

395
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,270
and tens of kind of analytics

396
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,170
that we do on top
of the calls.

397
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,910
Alright. So now so
we have the speech

398
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,510
technology, and
I'll give a demo

399
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,410
in a few minutes.

400
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,335
But all of this
is based on our

401
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:00,775
architecture for how we deal

402
00:13:00,775 --> 00:13:04,135
with speech and text in our,

403
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:06,635
Allego graph knowledge
graph platform.

404
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:10,375
So we can deal with only with

405
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,895
with any kind of input. Yeah.

406
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:14,160
So, obviously,
we can deal with

407
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,840
regular text that you find in

408
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,860
a in an email,
chat, etcetera.

409
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,340
we do a lot of work
with documents

410
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
where we use and
we can take any

411
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
kind of documents and then use

412
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,295
a tool called Apache Tika to

413
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:27,815
turn it into XML and turn it

414
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:28,955
into smaller pieces,

415
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:31,915
or we use voice to text,

416
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,075
and we ingest it
in AllegroGraph.

417
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,895
And so now we
have fragments of

418
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:39,990
text in our database,

419
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,690
but they're just unenriched,

420
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,450
just dumb pieces of text.

421
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,310
If you wanna
analyze that text,

422
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,050
you obviously
need a taxonomy.

423
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,250
So say you're trying to sell,

424
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:56,355
a sustain a a product around

425
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:57,315
sustainability, well,

426
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:58,935
then you better
have a taxonomy,

427
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:01,415
yeah, that knows
all the important

428
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,735
words related to
sustainability.

429
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,055
Or if you're selling
a particular

430
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:12,430
product for, one
of your clients,

431
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,330
well, you better have every

432
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,890
product that
the sales agent or

433
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,250
the customer talk
about and have

434
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,250
it in your taxonomy
with the pref

435
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,910
labels and the alt
labels and the whole,

436
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:26,005
hierarchy of of
important concepts

437
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,285
in in your data.

438
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,905
Yeah. So we work
with tools like

439
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,825
Smart Logic or Pool Party to

440
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:32,725
create these taxonomies.

441
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,705
We export the taxonomies in

442
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,185
AllegroGraph, and now
we can go to work.

443
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,100
Right? So,

444
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,140
we can take the taxonomy and

445
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,960
text fragments,

446
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,640
give it to our
entity extractor,

447
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,140
and put the entities back into

448
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,100
the knowledge graph.

449
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,960
In that way, enrich the text.

450
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,955
Now we have our own internal

451
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,475
entity extractor
in AllegoGraph

452
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:55,855
because we deal with very

453
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,295
complicated product names,

454
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:01,535
and there's not
a single entity

455
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:02,815
extract on the on the market

456
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,495
that is really
good at it unless

457
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:06,660
you provide every
alt label that

458
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,100
you can imagine
for a particular

459
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,660
product. but we found
that for product,

460
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,780
it's just better to just have

461
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,840
your own heuristic,

462
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,660
entity extractor so that you

463
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,940
don't have to
provide all these

464
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,980
alt labels. Anyway,

465
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,820
that is so we can use external

466
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,680
entity extractors
that we have around.

467
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,165
Then, obviously,
you wanna have,

468
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:26,485
the sentiment in the text.

469
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,025
So we have a sentiment
analyzer,

470
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,185
and we add sentiment
back to the text.

471
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,960
sometimes you wanna know what

472
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,480
kind of conversation
you're in.

473
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,240
For example, you
have a conversation

474
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,120
and you wanna know,

475
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,580
is this a direct sales,

476
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,220
or is this a request
for technical help,

477
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,800
or does the customer
wanna replace

478
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,635
all their technology that you

479
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,475
already have or just
wanna optimize it,

480
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,455
etcetera, etcetera.

481
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,755
So we do a lot
of work where we

482
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,575
label conversations
partly automatic,

483
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:00,455
partly by using,
humans in the loop.

484
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:00,995
Yeah.

485
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:02,375
And once we have the labels

486
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,415
added to conversations,

487
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,850
we give that to our
own text classifier.

488
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,990
we have our own internal one,

489
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,430
but you can use external ones

490
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,130
if you want to. Yeah.

491
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,810
And we even put
the classification

492
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,230
model in the the knowledge
graph itself.

493
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,070
So the the classifier becomes

494
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,325
part of the knowledge graph.

495
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,245
And now when we're in a new

496
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:24,825
conversation and someone
starts to talk,

497
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:26,665
within a few sentences,

498
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,065
we already know what kind of,

499
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,325
conversation does this,

500
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,005
and we can start giving real

501
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,910
time help to the the call
center agents.

502
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,150
The name another
important part

503
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,610
is that you really
wanna know,

504
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,670
especially when you build

505
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,790
recommendation engines,

506
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,470
is what are the terms that are

507
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,630
usually used together
with other terms.

508
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,275
So we do a lot of work
on co occurrence,

509
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,915
correlations, odd
ratios between terms,

510
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:55,275
and we use that
for, our, well,

511
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,575
recommendations and and and

512
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,255
other things. And once you've

513
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,055
done all of that,

514
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:01,735
then the fun can start and you

515
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:05,170
can do a semantic
search and and,

516
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,270
semantic exploration.

517
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,670
You can apply your analytics,

518
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,830
and you can do FR queries,

519
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,250
or you can provide real time

520
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,050
decision support.

521
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,830
So this is kind of
a little overview.

522
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,410
This is kind of
an overview of,

523
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:22,445
our our system. Alright.

524
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,765
So but I promise
to talk a little

525
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:26,145
bit more about our taxonomy

526
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,905
trained speech recognizer.

527
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:32,225
so as I said before,

528
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:35,060
one of the problems
with the commercial

529
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,440
speech recognizers
that you can buy,

530
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,380
yeah, or get
a subscription for

531
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,040
is that they're really good at

532
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,380
regular language
but fail, at,

533
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,300
product names, yeah,
at regular names.

534
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:52,555
So what you really
want is a speech

535
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:55,035
recognizer that you can train

536
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:57,035
from a taxonomy. So
that's what we did.

537
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:01,695
We took, we we we
created several,

538
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,370
tools where we can
take an an existing

539
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,810
taxonomy with the prev labels

540
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,870
and the alt labels,

541
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,230
use that to train
the speech recognizer.

542
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,870
and then when you get
the transcription

543
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,470
from your speech recognizer,

544
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,655
you'll find that
the quality of

545
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,755
the text output
is way better.

546
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:23,035
That makes it that the entity

547
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,475
extractor is way better,

548
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:26,535
and the output of
your entities.

549
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:28,215
And so the whole quality gets

550
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,515
better by having a taxonomy

551
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,795
trained speech recognizer.

552
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
So that is the thing that we

553
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,140
specialize in. So,

554
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,120
here is a little
demo of that.

555
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,480
Let me see if I have a better

556
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,460
version of that.

557
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,620
So for example,

558
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,335
after every after every sales

559
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,675
call that people
do, they are,

560
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:53,415
required to fill in a summary

561
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:54,615
of what they talked about with

562
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:55,195
the customer.

563
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:57,815
We call that a a note
taking app.

564
00:18:57,815 --> 00:18:59,175
And in that note taking app,

565
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,055
we wanna know, okay,

566
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,435
what products were mentioned,

567
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
where the competitors
mentioned,

568
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,400
what's the job title,

569
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,560
did people talk about the band

570
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,480
categories that I
talked about before.

571
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,920
And so,

572
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,545
let's see if I can
find this here.

573
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:17,505
Yeah. Here.

574
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,905
So here, we have someone,

575
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,525
that uses this
little application.

576
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:25,825
Let me see how that goes.

577
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,405
So I talked to Bob Johnson.

578
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,425
He's a VP of
engineering for the.

579
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,130
They said he they want to buy

580
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,310
some routers, and,
specifically,

581
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,730
they consider Cisco
RB two hundred

582
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,150
fifteen w and,

583
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:49,455
Jupyter CTP two
thousand fifty six.

584
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,215
Yeah. And we can't really hear

585
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:54,275
the audio. Oh, okay.
So, basically yeah.

586
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:58,015
Okay.

587
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:00,290
Let me just then do this.

588
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,570
We trained this beforehand.

589
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,930
Let me just explain
what happened.

590
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,030
Yeah? So, basically,
this is a person,

591
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,850
talking to this application to

592
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,290
give a summary of
what was talked

593
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,610
about and the output
of why and

594
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,450
and what you saw
here move around

595
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,325
is the same thing you
see on your phone.

596
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:17,445
That's why you're
talking through

597
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:18,965
your phone. You see
that the speech

598
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,405
recognizes making corrections

599
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:22,005
on the fly to get better

600
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:23,685
interpretations. But what we

601
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:25,865
then do is we take
out the entities

602
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:27,285
that are important to us,

603
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:28,405
like the products mentioned,

604
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:29,845
the competitors,
the job title,

605
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:30,780
and the band title.

606
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,300
So let me go here and go back

607
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,560
to my presentation. Yeah.

608
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,820
But the important
thing is the important

609
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,860
thing is that once we're done

610
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,840
with this conversation,

611
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,640
the entire
conversation will be

612
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,515
instantly in our
knowledge graph.

613
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,275
So what you see
here is for this

614
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,875
particular little session that

615
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,395
you just saw, and
I'm sorry that

616
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,255
the speech quality
wasn't better,

617
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,970
We see that there was this

618
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,950
particular session.

619
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,330
There's a bunch of phrases in

620
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,090
this session. One of them was

621
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,530
so I talked to Bob Johnson,

622
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,590
so VP of engineering.

623
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,570
And this is
the text fragment,

624
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,010
and then here is the result of

625
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,055
entity extraction.

626
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,495
And we found that, okay,

627
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:16,855
there was a job title in this

628
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:17,495
particular phrase.

629
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:18,795
It's VP of engineering,

630
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:21,975
which is has a broader
contact person.

631
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:23,815
So these are terms that come

632
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:24,635
from a taxonomy.

633
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:29,290
And here we see, that
is another phrase,

634
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,790
and here was about some
of the technologies

635
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,290
. And we'll find that in this

636
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,270
particular phrase,

637
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,910
we then found
the Jupyter routers.

638
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,290
well, anyway, as you can see,

639
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,110
various products.

640
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,405
So within a second
after you're

641
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,325
done talking,
it's already part

642
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,685
of your knowledge graph,

643
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,865
and you can do analytics
on top of that.

644
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:50,785
Now what did we learn,

645
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:53,805
during these last four years

646
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,485
that we've been
specializing on

647
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:57,085
speech technology and NLP with

648
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:57,780
knowledge graphs?

649
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,700
so the first thing
that I already

650
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,060
talked about is
that most speech

651
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,140
to text systems fail on very

652
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,580
specific domain words. Yeah?

653
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,260
What's product names,
medical terms,

654
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,480
financial terms, etcetera.

655
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,545
And the customization
is in its infancy.

656
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:20,285
So what you really need is get

657
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,045
really good at
customization in

658
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,745
a very short amount of time.

659
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:26,045
Because our
customer gets a new

660
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,485
campaign, and they can't wait

661
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,185
weeks to train a new model.

662
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,370
They they want
to start working

663
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,010
the next day.

664
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,950
So we spend a lot of time on

665
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,470
the customization processes.

666
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,210
And for static domains,

667
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,750
we can train language models,

668
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,730
but we also use speech to text

669
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,250
systems that allow
you to train

670
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,070
using phonetics.

671
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,655
That's a very important one.

672
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:47,935
Then, in the audience,

673
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:49,215
there are undoubtedly people

674
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,915
that built their
own taxonomies,

675
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:52,995
but I can tell
you that building

676
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:56,755
the old labels for terms,

677
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
that you normally do
for text is really,

678
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,800
really different than when you

679
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,260
do it for spoken
conversations.

680
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,980
Yeah?

681
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
The sales agent will say cat

682
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,800
nine k instead of
Cisco Catalyst

683
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,420
nine thousand l. Right?

684
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,625
So it's a lot of
work for us to

685
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,145
get this done.
And then there's

686
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:14,265
the issue with numbering.

687
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,105
Just a simple issue
with the word

688
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,105
nine thousand
hundred twenty one

689
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,025
or ninety one
hundred twenty one,

690
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,720
yeah, or nine one two one.

691
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,560
There's so many
ways that people

692
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,600
can say these numbers.

693
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,980
So you need to
deal with that.

694
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,000
Then it's pretty hard that are

695
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,480
it's it's a a problem that

696
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,400
especially with
short words. Yeah.

697
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,320
They overlap too often with

698
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,940
the regular English terms.

699
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:38,415
So we spend a lot of time on

700
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:41,295
making sure that
we actually get

701
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,495
the right word when we train

702
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,855
the systems. And then,

703
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:45,295
there's all these
little tricks

704
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:46,095
that you learn, like,

705
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:47,535
don't put the client
name before

706
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:48,575
every product name.

707
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:50,675
So in a Cisco catalog,

708
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,100
every word is
prefaced by the word

709
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,040
Cisco. But the problem is,

710
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,780
that if you do that
also in your,

711
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,940
in your when you train your

712
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,240
speech recognizer,

713
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,465
that the thing becomes
way too greedy.

714
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:06,785
Yeah?

715
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:08,465
And all the words
become Cisco.

716
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:09,745
So you don't wanna
do that thing.

717
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:12,325
So anyway and this is
just a few things.

718
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:14,225
I mean, there's
there's literally

719
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:15,265
hundreds of little things that

720
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,625
you learn when
you try to train

721
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,885
these systems in
a very fast way.

722
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,740
And we actually
wrote an application

723
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,160
just to deal with numbers and

724
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,640
product names to to
create a proposal

725
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,920
for phonetics, and,

726
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
you can contact
me later on how

727
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,500
we do that.

728
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,560
Then lesson three is,

729
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:32,975
you need a speech recognition

730
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:34,655
assist a speech
recognizer that

731
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,015
provides both real time and

732
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,395
batch processing, obviously.

733
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:40,195
if you wanna do
real time decision

734
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:42,895
support, you better
do real time

735
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:46,110
processing. One of the issues

736
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,470
is when you saw my demo,

737
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,410
you saw that
the speech recognizer

738
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,470
was correcting itself
all the time.

739
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,070
Yeah. So one of
the big questions

740
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,590
is how can how
long can you wait

741
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,970
till you trust
the transcription?

742
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:58,445
And, obviously,
for some things,

743
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:00,545
you don't need to
do real time,

744
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,085
processing batch processing is

745
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:03,745
good enough.

746
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,785
but not all speech recognizers

747
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,125
are really good at real time

748
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,105
decision support.

749
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,320
Then another thing is,

750
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,940
we as human beings are really

751
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,540
good at separating
who's who's talking,

752
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,480
who's saying what. Right?

753
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,485
But it's still an active area

754
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:26,845
of research, yeah,
to do it, for,

755
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:29,165
say, spoken
conversations where

756
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:30,785
you don't have
any visual help.

757
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:32,765
Yeah. And it's very important

758
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,185
because what we find
is, initially,

759
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,945
we were just taking
a transcription

760
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:39,540
of both the agent
and the customers

761
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,520
at the same time,

762
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,280
but the results weren't
that valuable.

763
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,780
What really makes a difference

764
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,700
is if you can split
what the customer

765
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,560
is saying about a product
or competitor,

766
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,145
etcetera, and what
the agent is saying.

767
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:54,005
Yeah. And so right now,

768
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:55,665
we don't trust the speech

769
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:57,825
recognition systems
too much to,

770
00:25:58,385 --> 00:25:59,905
tell you who's speaking,

771
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,585
but we try to do
it at the level

772
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,925
of the the the telephone
routers.

773
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,460
But the problem
with the telephone

774
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,300
routers is that
it's also fairly

775
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,440
new to all of them,

776
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,900
because they were
always used well,

777
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,360
they were built for regular

778
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,460
human to human
conversations and not to,

779
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,480
help speech
recognition systems.

780
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:20,045
So, again, this is all fairly

781
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,425
new and exciting research.

782
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,025
then some speech recognizers.

783
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:27,585
So the other thing is you can

784
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,840
so speech recognizers
make mistakes.

785
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,860
Right?

786
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,720
So you get
a transcription back.

787
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,580
but some speech
recognizers give

788
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,740
you for a phrase or a word

789
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,720
multiple interpretations.

790
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,360
So then in your
entity recognizer

791
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,560
or phrase recognizer,

792
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,285
you can still do a lot of,

793
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,305
post processing. Yeah.

794
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:50,565
and so, again, if you wanna

795
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:51,765
choose a speech recognizer,

796
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:53,125
you better get one
that gives you,

797
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:55,225
multiple interpretations
of words.

798
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,805
and then how well does your

799
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:00,585
speech recognizer with
other languages,

800
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,720
and are they all of
the same quality?

801
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,780
Well, some of you
live in the world

802
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,700
of text analytics, and,

803
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,580
you probably know that even if

804
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,620
you just do NLP
on static text,

805
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,820
yeah, there's a difference in

806
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,755
the quality of,

807
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:19,715
the the the languages
even within

808
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,255
the same product. Yeah.

809
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:22,675
The product might be really,

810
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:25,255
really good for, English,

811
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,215
but then way worse
for, say, Korean.

812
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:29,190
Yeah.

813
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,110
Maybe because for English,

814
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,030
they use WordNet, internally,

815
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,830
but for Korean,

816
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,750
they only use lists
or words. Yeah?

817
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,710
So you get different.

818
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,230
But in speed
recognition system,

819
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,170
it's even more
pronounced. Yeah?

820
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,750
So when you look at the speech

821
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,550
recognition system,

822
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,905
you also wanna
look at how good

823
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:46,265
are they for multiple dialects

824
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,485
of English or Spanish.

825
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,065
And some of them are starting

826
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:50,905
to specialize to
kinda recognize

827
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,445
almost all kinds of English,

828
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:54,685
or all kinds of Spanish,

829
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:57,085
and some of them only
do one dialect.

830
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,350
So and then on top
of all of this,

831
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:07,150
if you, like we do,
work on on creating,

832
00:28:09,945 --> 00:28:11,305
speech recognition systems for

833
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:12,665
multiple language as well.

834
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,445
It's a huge problem that if

835
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,705
the people that work for you

836
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:16,905
don't speak all
these languages,

837
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,665
so that's
a a little additional

838
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,445
problem that you might
wanna deal with.

839
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:22,445
Then quality control.

840
00:28:23,225 --> 00:28:25,400
so we learned that,

841
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,260
automated testing
is like, well,

842
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,800
everywhere. It's
very important.

843
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,020
So we have for every campaign

844
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,980
and for every language,

845
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,360
a gold standard conversation,

846
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,440
and then we run it
every x minutes

847
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,020
to see if the right words and

848
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,240
the phrases come back.

849
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:41,475
And we also found
that you can't

850
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,235
do it without
a human in the loop

851
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:44,915
because if you train a speech

852
00:28:44,915 --> 00:28:47,095
recognized on your
text taxonomies,

853
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:49,875
some of the regular English or

854
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,335
any other language
deteriorates,

855
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,730
and only a human
can detect that

856
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,530
can detect that.

857
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,910
So we try to avoid,
an I'm sorry.

858
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,810
Now I'm going too fast. Yeah.

859
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,970
So only a human
can detect that,

860
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,810
so we always have
a human being

861
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,330
that at least
does some quality

862
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,365
control to see where we are.

863
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:12,105
And, what this person actually

864
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:14,165
most looks at is
to avoid false

865
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:14,885
positives. Yeah.

866
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,665
We don't wanna
tell our customer

867
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:20,265
that in conversations,
a particular,

868
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,190
product was mentioned
too many times.

869
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,610
We rather we rather
not recognize

870
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,890
the term and miss some words

871
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,350
than that we tell the customer

872
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,410
that there are too
many of a particular

873
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,210
word recognized.

874
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,905
And, again, you need automated

875
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:36,165
testing and a human
little loop

876
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,325
to deal with that. Alright.

877
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:39,145
So concluding,

878
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,185
if you wanna do
a speech technology

879
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,745
project, we are really
happy to help,

880
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:47,690
and help you to incorporate,

881
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,910
the output of
speech technology

882
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,590
in your knowledge
graphs because

883
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,790
there's really some amazing

884
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,390
business benefits
in all of that,

885
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,310
and it's really,
really fun to do.

886
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,590
So thank you for
your attention,

887
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,450
and maybe there are
some questions.

888
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,435
Thank you for your talk.

889
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:10,275
it was great, as
usual, I should say.

890
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:12,655
We we have one
question here in

891
00:30:12,655 --> 00:30:13,315
the chat,

892
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:20,550
about how you combine speech

893
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:25,610
analytics and EU,
GDPR regulations.

894
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,410
how is that working together?

895
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:36,855
Well, the same kind of applies

896
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:38,135
in the United States too.

897
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:40,635
Some states allow
you to record,

898
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:44,090
conversations
with permission.

899
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,630
Some states allow
you to record

900
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,450
without permission.

901
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,590
but in a country
like Germany,

902
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,050
nothing is allowed. Yeah.

903
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,730
But the laws have not been yet

904
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,025
really defined
for listening in

905
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,765
using speech technology.

906
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:04,905
Right? So it does
not so you are

907
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,505
allowed to listen
in with a an an

908
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:10,780
automated system and extract

909
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,700
the most important
words out of a text.

910
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,960
There's no one I
haven't seen yet,

911
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,280
anyone that would,

912
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,540
forbid you to do that.

913
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,340
Although, of course,

914
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,995
the GDPR still
completely applies

915
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:26,475
because even if
you get elements

916
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:28,415
out of a a conversation,

917
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:31,355
that's coupled to
a particular customer,

918
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,795
and that customer, of course,

919
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:33,935
is under the GDPR.

920
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,330
So if you wanna
forget about it,

921
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,870
then you have to be
able to forget.

922
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,370
But remember,
when I showed you

923
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,030
my picture of,
a knowledge graph,

924
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,370
we do have because
we have this

925
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,010
knowledge graph,

926
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,955
we actually know
every word that

927
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:51,135
every customer ever
ever uttered.

928
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,115
Right? So we can we actually

929
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:55,215
have a system where
we can forget.

930
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:56,955
Yeah. Because we
have completely

931
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:57,455
documented.

932
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:00,555
But it's a it's
a very complicated

933
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:01,835
topic for call center.

934
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:02,895
Really, really complicated.

935
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,260
another question
from Frederick

936
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,040
Landbisque. Bisque,

937
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,460
did you acquire from that

938
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,460
foundational
taxonomies to jump

939
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,360
start the training,

940
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,480
or and or or have
you incorporated

941
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,865
open vocabularies
in in your system?

942
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:20,545
Actually, we,

943
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:24,945
so one of the fears of any

944
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,345
customer is that they have to

945
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,285
do all
the taxonomy development

946
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,725
all the way from the start.

947
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:34,940
Yeah. And so we
use, at at entry,

948
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,680
use the the, want technology.

949
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,180
There's a company
called want,

950
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,460
w a n d, yeah, that
provides some,

951
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,760
foundation taxonomies.

952
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,140
And so you can
start with those,

953
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,360
and then you can expand.

954
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:49,765
These wall taxonomies
don't have

955
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:50,565
many alt labels,

956
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,325
but at least it's
always a great

957
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:54,965
start of the core
hierarchy that

958
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,505
applies in
the particular domain.
