1
00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:02,515
So today I'm gonna
make a presentation

2
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:05,215
about complexity and more

3
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,355
specifically tailored,

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,835
towards like
around visualizing

5
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:11,380
graphs because this
is a conference

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
about graphs. But this,

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,140
format is gonna be a bit,

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,280
different from what,
you're used to,

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,435
I think, because
I want to make

10
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,435
a presentation and and to be

11
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:22,255
very interactive,

12
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:25,535
meaning that I will
ask, questions.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,360
And depending on
how you choose

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,200
to answer, we will go through

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,500
one or the other way.

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,720
So it's very easy to do.

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,400
Basically you just go here,

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,895
you can scan if
you have a phone,

19
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:37,875
it's even better.

20
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:39,935
You can just either
you can join

21
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,175
slido dot com and
you put the data

22
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,060
art as a hashtag
or you can just

23
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,300
scan it with your phone and it

24
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,580
will automatically join.

25
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,100
And so it's pretty
cool because

26
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,220
you will see that the results

27
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,120
as you vote,

28
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:54,915
are completely integrated in

29
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:55,575
the presentation.

30
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:57,555
So it's it's pretty
cool as a as

31
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,660
a feature. And I will ask you

32
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,700
just to make sure that you're

33
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,200
ready and to know
a bit more about you.

34
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,580
You this is the one
what it looks like.

35
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,400
Ask a question,

36
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,820
and you can see on the left,

37
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,195
you can always join,
the present,

38
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,715
like the presentation
and the polling

39
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:15,155
part. And so this
is like a question

40
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,115
because we're gonna talk about

41
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:17,955
visualization and especially

42
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,510
around graphs. So it's a good

43
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,470
idea for me to, you know,

44
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,110
try to adapt also
the content and see,

45
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,070
as you can see here,

46
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,270
we would see in real time how

47
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,330
many people vote.

48
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,145
And it's cool because you see

49
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:28,945
people are fighting.

50
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:30,565
You can also edit your answers

51
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,705
as we will go as
we will see in

52
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,705
the in the next slides
if you want to,

53
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,325
you know, go back and forth.

54
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,900
So we have eighteen people out

55
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,740
of I think fifty three.

56
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,980
So let's let's get
everyone, you know,

57
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,175
get everyone on board And in

58
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,815
the meantime, so, yeah,

59
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,575
this presentation
is really about,

60
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,415
data art and I'm
not really sure

61
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:52,775
if you're familiar
with the field.

62
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:55,110
So I'm gonna first try to

63
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,630
introduce what is data art,

64
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,070
the difference between data

65
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,250
visualization and data art,

66
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,890
go through different
example of

67
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,295
graph visualizations.

68
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:07,075
And, if you have time,

69
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,695
if you are nice people,

70
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,115
we'll also go towards,

71
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:11,955
another kind of work that I do

72
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,530
with more with
with ai which is

73
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,750
about neural networks.

74
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,570
It's not exactly
a knowledge graph,

75
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,690
but it's still
around networks.

76
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,610
So it makes sense
to talk about

77
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,450
this here and at the end also

78
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,385
have another surprise.

79
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:27,525
So, let's try to have
a bit more people.

80
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:28,725
We have twenty five people.

81
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:30,180
You can just join us.

82
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,300
Go here on the website,

83
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,300
put the hashtag or
just scan here,

84
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,780
the the QR code
with your phone,

85
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,900
and then it's automatic.

86
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,765
It's gonna be refreshed
automatically.

87
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:39,885
You don't have
to do anything.

88
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:43,105
It's just, it gets automatic.

89
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:44,365
And if you're not,

90
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,965
if you don't have
time to join now,

91
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,440
don't worry. The
next question,

92
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
you always have
this left panel

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
so you can always
join in and,

94
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
you know, participate.

95
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,160
So from what we
have right now,

96
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,675
we see that most
people so you,

97
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,395
you dabble, right?

98
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,475
So, you know,
about database and

99
00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,775
some people like really,

100
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:01,835
like seven percent
of, of people,

101
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:03,710
people really like my life

102
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,250
revolves around data
and visualization.

103
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,770
So you guys are
really expert,

104
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,590
but, for most people I think

105
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,550
it's going to be pretty new.

106
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,590
We know I have an idea of what

107
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,095
database is and,

108
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,095
but we want to know more.

109
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:15,315
So let's, let's begin,

110
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,275
just to quickly introduce,

111
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,355
who I am quickly.

112
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,730
I have a background
in data science and,

113
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,050
I also, and are like switched

114
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,050
after my PhD in more into data

115
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,565
visualization. But,

116
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:31,085
today I'm going to go and talk

117
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,145
about data art,

118
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,565
which is something
that I've been,

119
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,865
like doing for, I'd
say seven years now,

120
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,670
professionally. So I basically

121
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,970
earn money selling data art.

122
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,090
This is, like, the definition

123
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,230
of professional. Right?

124
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,370
And, so this is gonna be we're

125
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,775
gonna be focused
about the work

126
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,795
that I did on on data art and

127
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:51,335
and then it relates
to, graphs because,

128
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:53,275
I did my PhD in graph
visualization,

129
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:55,015
basically. So it's
gonna be very

130
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,070
well connected.

131
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,710
So I just wanted to introduce

132
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,210
how I really
started, you know,

133
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,335
to, play and and, you know,

134
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,355
work about data
visualization.

135
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,135
This is an actual
picture of my

136
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,975
board back in the day
and you know,

137
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,335
people were asking me, hey,

138
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,275
what are you working on?

139
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,920
You know, this is
like the classic.

140
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,300
If you do, like, a thesis,

141
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
people ask you that
all the time.

142
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,640
And I was very naive at that

143
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,840
time because I thought people

144
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,645
were actually they were really

145
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,005
interested in
knowing the answer.

146
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,365
So I was like
going go straight

147
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,045
to the board, trying
to get a look,

148
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,185
this is what I do.

149
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,165
And then I realized
this was just,

150
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:31,370
you know, they were asking me

151
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,430
just out of courtesy.

152
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,150
So I was I was like
a bit frustrated,

153
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,690
but I realized, okay,
maybe if I could,

154
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,450
you know, try to
visualize what I do,

155
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,515
people will get
more interested

156
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:41,075
because you know,

157
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,355
you can see it and it's not

158
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,375
about math or code
or anything.

159
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:46,675
So this is how I
started and get

160
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:48,195
interested into the field of

161
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:49,655
data visualization itself.

162
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,480
So what is database?

163
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,960
Basically, if I
were to, like,

164
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,560
an outline of three points,

165
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,615
database is about to,

166
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:01,395
it's to be the most efficient

167
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:02,755
effective in communicating

168
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,475
statistics or
objects or numbers

169
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,780
in a visual manner. Right?

170
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,600
So the keyword here
is to be effective,

171
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,500
which is different
from data art.

172
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,280
So you want to
have to minimize

173
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,505
the time it takes for other

174
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,105
the audience to
understand what

175
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:18,225
you see on the screen.

176
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:19,665
For instance,
here we see a map

177
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,185
with dots, we see bar chart,

178
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,020
a line chart. And just by,

179
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,440
looking at the legend
or the the title,

180
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,340
like the description
of the chart,

181
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,700
it should get pretty it should

182
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,460
be pretty easy to
understand what it is.

183
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,365
This is the goal
of database to

184
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,925
communicate, but
also to explore.

185
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,525
If you work if you
work as a scientist,

186
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,205
you you have no you
have a big dataset.

187
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,970
You have no idea
of what it is.

188
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,810
You're gonna start
by creating some,

189
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,170
you know, basic charts just to

190
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,290
get your hands on the data,

191
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,910
understand what what's
the distribution,

192
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,490
the length, the size,

193
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,110
the clusters and so forth.

194
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,495
So it's a very good
tool to explore.

195
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:53,315
But basically all in all,

196
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:55,155
the point is to develop one's

197
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,655
cognition about
the underlying dataset.

198
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,710
So this is like my definition

199
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,610
of database.

200
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,190
Now if you know a bit
about database,

201
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,355
you can, like look up on Andy

202
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,355
Kirk's like website.
Yes. Yes.

203
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:08,915
Like I don't know,

204
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,035
six hundred different tools,

205
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,955
like everything
that is related

206
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,120
to data visualization.

207
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Most people here
will be familiar

208
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,640
I think with the tableau or

209
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,600
power bi or click
like there are

210
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,780
three main competitors
in this space.

211
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,025
So So basically,

212
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,145
if you're not really familiar

213
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,245
with database, you
take the tool,

214
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,865
right? You go, here,
this is tableau,

215
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:29,985
you have your data,

216
00:06:29,985 --> 00:06:32,780
you drag and drop
on columns row up,

217
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,460
you have a chart
pre made for you,

218
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,340
you try to color,

219
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,440
you put the time
and that's it.

220
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,440
You are doing data
visualization.

221
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,845
So why do we need
to go beyond?

222
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,485
Why do do we even care about

223
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,105
creating custom
data visualization

224
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:48,605
when you have like
good software

225
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:50,510
that do it for
you automatically

226
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,710
and very efficiently.

227
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,110
Well, all in all,
it comes to impact.

228
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,175
If you do like
dashboarding all

229
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,175
the time, it's
difficult for people,

230
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,415
you know, to have
something like

231
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,275
to remember the visualization

232
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,990
to be remembered by because it

233
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,370
they all look alike.

234
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,010
So what if you
work in database,

235
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,930
you're striving for impact.

236
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:13,905
So you want to be impactful so

237
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:15,445
that the message that
you communicate,

238
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:17,585
the story that you
tell, you know,

239
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,985
helps people, take this new

240
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,905
decisions or
reason about their

241
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:23,560
businesses and so forth.

242
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,140
So if you want
to have impact,

243
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,280
what do you do in general?

244
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,780
Some people, you know,

245
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
they go on the street
and they protest.

246
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,500
I come from France.

247
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,645
This is our specialty,
as you all know.

248
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:33,845
So then when they
go on the street,

249
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,865
they try to protest
to influence people,

250
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,645
right? This is one way, I'm,

251
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:39,925
I'm trying to do
the other way.

252
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,865
So this is supposed
to be a mirror

253
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
and I'm more,
you know, maybe,

254
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,080
you know, Michael Jackson,

255
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,380
man in the mirror song.

256
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm I'm think if you want to

257
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
like influence people,

258
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,795
it has to come from within and

259
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:50,915
to do that,

260
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:54,115
what better way than
using art to do so?

261
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,655
Because art is very subjective

262
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,575
in its nature. So if you can,

263
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,950
if you're touched by a piece,

264
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,230
you can really, you know,

265
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,630
it can change your the way of

266
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,390
thinking and how you perceive

267
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,290
life in general.

268
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,275
So instead of
doing the protest

269
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:07,995
because I'm alone,

270
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,695
I cannot really
organize anything.

271
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:11,275
Maybe we should try to go more

272
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,955
on the artistic routes because

273
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,895
it's less frightened,
frightening.

274
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,690
It's very deeply personal and

275
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,390
you can have a greater
greater impact.

276
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,330
So this is basically
how I, you know,

277
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,845
started and doing
data art and say,

278
00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:26,205
okay. Maybe if I
can do a piece

279
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,405
and I can have more impact,

280
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,565
then my goal is complete.

281
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:31,185
And my goal being
as a scientist,

282
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,105
try to communicate science,

283
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,030
make people understand
complexity,

284
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,130
such as, like like,

285
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,490
understand how graphs work,

286
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,825
the connections,
and so forth.

287
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:42,025
So this this, like,

288
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,205
was the whole
motivation here,

289
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,385
and we're gonna
talk about this.

290
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:46,665
So, basically, if you look at

291
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:47,785
at this particular piece,

292
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,065
you have no idea what it is

293
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,365
because there is
no description.

294
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,150
And, but you you
believe me when

295
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,930
I said that this
is based on data.

296
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,190
So what is data art?

297
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,310
If we are to, you know,

298
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,370
give a definition,

299
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,645
data art is not
data visualization

300
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,865
because the goal here,

301
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,205
the most important part is to

302
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,485
create emotions.

303
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,600
So first and foremost,

304
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,380
you want to
maximize emotions.

305
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
And hopefully for instance,

306
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,820
if you see the piece
here on left,

307
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,160
you want to get closer because

308
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,120
maybe you like the colors,

309
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,305
maybe you like the shape.

310
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,705
But as you can
see below here,

311
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:22,545
you also have
a description and

312
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,225
this is where
the artistic message

313
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,985
comes. So in some pieces you

314
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:27,265
have no description at all and

315
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,160
it's up to the viewer
to understand

316
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,260
what's what's really
happening here.

317
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
Data art is different because

318
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,220
it is based on data.

319
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,220
It has a more objective truth

320
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,045
than the solar arts.
It's imagination.

321
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,585
Right? So basically you get it

322
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,425
attracted by the colors,
the shapes,

323
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,285
so forth. Then you
read the description

324
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,570
and hopefully you
reflect on yourself.

325
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,810
This is how the message
gets to you.

326
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,870
And all in all,

327
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,290
back to the same thing that we

328
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,110
have in database,

329
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,755
we develop cognition
about the underlying

330
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,435
dataset,
the scientific principles

331
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,135
and other types of things.

332
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,735
So this is basically
my definition

333
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,095
of data art. I
hope that it was

334
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:03,440
clear the definition between

335
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,620
database and data art.

336
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
And you could you
could like, you know,

337
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
ask me, okay, why are you are

338
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,455
you the only guy
doing this data art?

339
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,135
And I'm not.

340
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,815
This is from a paper from back

341
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,175
in the day two thousand and

342
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,955
seven on the database
conference.

343
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:22,530
You showing
the merits of doing

344
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,830
artistic data visualization.

345
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,330
So this was, like,

346
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,630
something that
people noticed,

347
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,770
like, even even before that.

348
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,605
But, you know, trying
to understand,

349
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,525
explain that if
you put emotions,

350
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,585
you have a greater impact and

351
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:36,425
people find the charts or like

352
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:37,805
the images more memorable.

353
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,560
And so it's actually a good

354
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,660
thing to have
visual embellishments

355
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
even though it makes maybe

356
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,000
sometimes the data a bit less

357
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,420
clear to perceive
at first glance,

358
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,355
but because it has a greater

359
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,455
impact and they
can measure that,

360
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,435
all in all, it's better.

361
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,115
So this is how I try to also

362
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,760
connect the artistic
part with the,

363
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,360
like a field of
research as well.

364
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,280
So if you are
interested, you can,

365
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
look it up. But basically,

366
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,455
how how does it work?

367
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,215
What what is
the design process

368
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:08,175
to to create some
graphs and art

369
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,315
with graphs? For instance,

370
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:10,895
what it's very similar if you

371
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,175
come from a design
background,

372
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,395
this should be very familiar.

373
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,900
It's exactly the same
as database.

374
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,180
It's gonna be interactive,

375
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,880
meaning that it's
not like, oh,

376
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,680
I have an idea.

377
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm gonna work two weeks and

378
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,465
then that's it.

379
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:24,225
It doesn't work like this.

380
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,225
It's sometimes
the most frustrating

381
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,985
part is, like,
sometimes in two hours,

382
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,345
you have you have you actually

383
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,465
have the final design,

384
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:32,830
but you spend three
weeks refining

385
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,190
the thing just to go back to

386
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,870
the first one
because the client

387
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,370
likes it. So it's
it's iterative.

388
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:39,885
But the question
that you have,

389
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,325
you ask yourself is like,

390
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,005
are you going to create
a static piece,

391
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:44,525
like an image? Is it going to

392
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:45,805
be animated? Maybe it's going

393
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,675
to be a video. Is it going to

394
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,940
be an interactive
data visualization

395
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,620
or data art piece
so people can

396
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,720
click or have like sensors to

397
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,280
make it move in real time?

398
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,855
Is it gonna be abstract
or figurative?

399
00:11:58,555 --> 00:11:59,755
What are the different shapes

400
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:00,635
that you can play with?

401
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:01,595
What are the dimensions that

402
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,875
you're going to
take in the data,

403
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,155
the clusters, the different

404
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,900
techniques and have to strike

405
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,980
the right balance
between order

406
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,320
and chaos. So exactly
the basically,

407
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,900
I would say the the things you

408
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,340
have to take into
account and colors.

409
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,185
Of course, people like to do

410
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,945
black and white. I
like to do colors.

411
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,625
So, and because it's data are

412
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,585
they have to mean something.

413
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:21,025
So if they have
the same color,

414
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,385
they should belong to the same

415
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,685
cluster for instance.

416
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,570
And, so they have a mean.

417
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,150
So, basically, if
you had to say,

418
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,870
like, to describe
my job in one

419
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,615
side would be
data, some code,

420
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:36,175
and basically you
create a visual

421
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,375
that that that
means something.

422
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,055
I hope that it's like one data

423
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,350
art in one side.
This would be it.

424
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,070
So now I wanna go
back to the example

425
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,350
that I showed before,

426
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,630
and this is about the Montreux

427
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,230
Jazz Festival,
one of my favorite

428
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,285
examples. So if you're not

429
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:51,485
familiar with
the Montreux Jazz,

430
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:53,085
this is one of the most famous

431
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,005
music festival in
the world in Montreux.

432
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,225
Montreux is in Switzerland.

433
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,660
And, just to give
you an idea,

434
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,160
it's pretty big
as a festival.

435
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,680
It has been going on for more

436
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,040
than fifty four years now.

437
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,325
And is that it has
eleven thousand

438
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:08,665
hours of videos with
different cameras,

439
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,585
six thousand hours of audio,

440
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,410
more than a hundred
thousand pictures,

441
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,530
but and, basically,

442
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,050
the dataset is two point seven

443
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,670
petabyte and, like,

444
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,170
spread across two different

445
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,010
dataset cooled by the water of

446
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,150
the Lake Geneva.

447
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,155
So this is like
the the data we have to,

448
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,415
play with, which
pretty big. Right?

449
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:29,440
And basically
what I I tried to

450
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,800
make some
visualization to give

451
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
you an idea of
what you have in

452
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,280
the dataset. Here,

453
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,800
each dot here is
an artist that

454
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,280
played at the Montreux
Jazz, with this,

455
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,140
his location, its location.

456
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,125
And you see that the the notes

457
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,405
here have different shades.

458
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,365
They're more, like,

459
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,645
the more purple you are,

460
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,345
it means that
the more connected

461
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,990
musically to
the other artists.

462
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,250
So you can ask,

463
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,190
how do you compute the musical

464
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,790
similarity between artists?

465
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,910
And to do that,

466
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,035
we have to analyze
the sound itself.

467
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,895
And remember that
mantra is a whole

468
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:01,815
new setup. It's
not the same as

469
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:02,875
the studio version.

470
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,510
You have to analyze
the rhythm,

471
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,350
the melody,
the notes, chords,

472
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,190
harmony, things like this from

473
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,250
the reading, the signal,

474
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,810
then try to compare
songs together

475
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:13,775
and see if this sound alike,

476
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,375
and then grouped
all these songs

477
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,735
by artists. And
this is how you

478
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,355
get artistic similarity,

479
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:19,615
which is pretty cool because

480
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:21,055
people have been using this

481
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,140
particular map, for
ethnomusicology.

482
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
So to understand
the origin of music,

483
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,120
for instance, here
would be Bikin,

484
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
which is the most
famous festive,

485
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,235
like, musician
and the jazz and

486
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:33,155
see how he influenced
with blues,

487
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:34,755
you know, other
people that came

488
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,115
in the festival as well.

489
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,955
So this is an example
of a database.

490
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,155
This has nothing
to do with art,

491
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:40,830
but just to, as
I said before,

492
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,650
to give you an idea of what,

493
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,610
what is the dataset,

494
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,050
and then we progressively move

495
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,830
on to the more artistic part.

496
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,275
Another visualization
that we have,

497
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,115
this is about the evolution of

498
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:55,275
musical genres over time in

499
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,335
the Montreux Jazz.

500
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,230
So as you can see here
at the beginning,

501
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,630
it's like the the curve
is really

502
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,410
narrow because we
only have, like,

503
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,755
the festival was
basically three

504
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,855
days in one, like venue.

505
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:08,995
But at the end
now it's supposed

506
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,435
to be fifteen days in three

507
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:11,335
different stages.

508
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,140
So we have more in terms of

509
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,520
volume and more songs,

510
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,680
getting played each day.

511
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,420
And what's also
interesting here

512
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,700
is that the proportion
of jazz,

513
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,365
which is the pink
one in the middle

514
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:23,285
is more or less
constant over time,

515
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:25,445
but we add more
and more different

516
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:26,425
musical genres.

517
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,265
So it's not about
jazz anymore.

518
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,410
Even like back in the day,

519
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,430
as you can see,
you have hip hop,

520
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,050
reggae, metal,
electro and so forth.

521
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,490
So it's really like a very

522
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,485
international music festival

523
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,825
even though it's, you know,

524
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:42,325
it's dead centered
around the the jazz.

525
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,465
So this is a bit
more abstract.

526
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,905
This is called a stream graph

527
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,130
as a visualization,
and it shows,

528
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,490
like, the evolution
in time with

529
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,930
the width being
proportional to

530
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,150
the number of songs.

531
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,850
And now we I want
to go back to

532
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,210
the image that
you saw before,

533
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,555
the very which is
about the artist

534
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,075
of the jazz itself
connected if

535
00:15:59,075 --> 00:15:59,275
they've been playing
together on stage.

536
00:15:59,275 --> 00:15:59,442
So basically you
concatenate and

537
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:07,220
you you flatten all

538
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,240
the concerts in one dataset.

539
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,380
And because, you
know, artists,

540
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,060
they tend to come
several times

541
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,820
at the Montreux Jazz and each

542
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,565
time they come,
most of the stars,

543
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,685
they come with a new lineup,

544
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,305
a new bassist, a new drummer,

545
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,045
a new singer,
sometimes if you're

546
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,640
like a guitarist
and so forth.

547
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,480
And so you can connect
all the different

548
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,040
artists of the jazz
if they play

549
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,520
together, on stage
at a certain

550
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,945
point in time.
And this is what

551
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,945
we had here. So
this is like a very

552
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:35,805
nice, simplified schematic,

553
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,945
but if you scale
it to the, like,

554
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,625
whole dataset, not
the whole dataset,

555
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,530
but like the most interesting

556
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,030
part at the center,
you would see here,

557
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,370
all the connection,

558
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,690
the big yellow dot
here is Vivi King.

559
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,935
You have Santana
here and George

560
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:52,095
Duke and you see
that all the lines

561
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,795
seems to converge
at the center.

562
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:55,055
And it makes sense
if you think

563
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,850
about it because the artist at

564
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,610
the center are mostly jasmine

565
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,770
and blues men because
it's the montage

566
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,710
jazz, but also because
the music itself,

567
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,710
you know, calls for
collaboration,

568
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,210
you want to jam
with other people.

569
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,475
So if you're a Jasmine,

570
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,195
you will change you.

571
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,155
And each time you will come up

572
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,455
with a new quartet quintet.

573
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:11,895
And this way you have,

574
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,770
you get very connected
at the center.

575
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,930
So all the lines seems
to converge here,

576
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,290
and you can be very popular as

577
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,570
an artist. And
I've just played

578
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,330
here in this small
cluster with

579
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,745
your band. But if you didn't

580
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:22,945
really mix with
other artists,

581
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:24,965
you will not be connected
at the center.

582
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:26,385
So we have this,

583
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:28,725
what we call the Montra
jazz galaxy.

584
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,570
The whole piece
was called jazz

585
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,830
luminaries and it was
displayed in this,

586
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,330
full dome. So it's
like a small,

587
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,790
very small planetarium.

588
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,845
And we also, created this

589
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:41,725
controller here,

590
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,585
which is actually
a phone inside

591
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,725
where you can, you
know, play around.

592
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:46,705
So it was interactive.

593
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,670
You could select an artist.

594
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,170
And when you click
on the artist,

595
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,530
see all the different concerts

596
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,050
and then listen to
all the songs.

597
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,810
So imagine being
able to listen

598
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,350
to more than two point seven

599
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,755
petabyte of data in
your fingertips.

600
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,295
So it was pretty cool
as an experience.

601
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:02,915
I want to show I I
can only show you,

602
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,435
like, part of
the video because

603
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:05,900
everything is
copyrighted as you

604
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,740
can imagine, but it would

605
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,120
basically look like this.

606
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,880
People will, you know,

607
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,940
lay on the floor and have this

608
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,580
weird controller.

609
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,365
And as you will
move it, you know,

610
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:16,805
in space, you
would create this

611
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,765
fisheye effect and
on the three d,

612
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,525
like graph that you see here

613
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,305
with all the different,
pictures.

614
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,620
And then if you click
on the the most,

615
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,420
the selected note,

616
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,860
you would see that everything

617
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,700
will slide and
all the different

618
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,725
concert for this
artist would come up.

619
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,325
Then you click on the concert

620
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,945
and you'd be able to browse

621
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,225
the different tracks.

622
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,285
So this is,

623
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,350
I hope that I
know it's a bit,

624
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,790
underwhelming
because you cannot

625
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,750
see the whole experience,

626
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,510
but I hope that
you get the idea

627
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,610
through this, like,
smaller video.

628
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,265
So this is, like,
the the the two d,

629
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,345
render of the three
d mesh that

630
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,545
we we saw before.

631
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:55,065
And then what we
saw just before

632
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,505
the BB King stuff is we get

633
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:57,360
the center here.

634
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,340
I hope that, this example,

635
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
and it gives you a better idea

636
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
of what data art is and how we

637
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,075
can go from the the old data,

638
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,055
the data visualization,

639
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,875
and then create something
more abstract,

640
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,595
which has a story and and to

641
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:14,295
arrive to this
particular piece.

642
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,850
But now I want to get back to

643
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,070
what I said at the beginning.

644
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,490
And I said at
the beginning that

645
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,690
you were there here, right?

646
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,370
So maybe you
recall those books

647
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,295
back in the day where
you, you know,

648
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,215
if you want to make
this decision,

649
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:27,695
you go to page eighty
four and then you,

650
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:28,975
you turn left and you die.

651
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:30,015
And most of the time you have

652
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,875
to go back to the beginning
of the book,

653
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,430
but we're not going
to die here today,

654
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,090
but you are going
to be the hero,

655
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,290
meaning that depending on what

656
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,650
you choose, we will go through

657
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,575
one of the other
different artworks.

658
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,175
So you are in control of

659
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,555
democratically of
what we can do here.

660
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:48,575
So I will first ask
you to pick a shape.

661
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:50,100
So I'm gonna ask
you this question

662
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,760
right now,

663
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,200
here and it should
appear on your phone.

664
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:58,505
And so let me and to make sure

665
00:19:58,505 --> 00:19:59,225
that it's true,

666
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,825
we can also see in real time.

667
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,805
So I'm not cheating.

668
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,405
You can see that
you can change.

669
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,140
It's up to you.

670
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
So we have thirty seven people

671
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,400
voting beforehand.

672
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,920
So let's, let's
try to have a bit

673
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
more today. And now in this

674
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,660
particular question,

675
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,105
what's really funny about this

676
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:20,205
is that depending
on the demographics

677
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,125
of the crowd, you
have different

678
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,450
choices. I give one of, like,

679
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,610
kind of this talk
in the US and

680
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,610
in Europe, and
it's it's always

681
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,610
different. But
Square, you know,

682
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,395
just really seem to be, like,

683
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:33,435
no one likes square.

684
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:35,295
Either a circle or a triangle

685
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:36,735
and you see people
are fighting.

686
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,235
If you if you're
at a square and

687
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:38,875
you feel alone,

688
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,590
you can also edit your answer

689
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,210
and choose one or the other

690
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,910
because sometimes
you have like

691
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,590
a it's a perfect match.

692
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,970
So I have to choose
it randomly.

693
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,695
It's not not
because I said that

694
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:51,735
square has no love.

695
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:53,015
People are gonna going back to

696
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:54,875
edit the answers
and and, you know,

697
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,450
changing and go
back to square.

698
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,410
So this is really,

699
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,570
you understand
how politics work

700
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,610
politics work, right,

701
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,870
with this kind of line
voting and stuff.

702
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,155
So okay. I think so.

703
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:06,115
Circle and triangle.

704
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:08,515
So if none of
the square, okay.

705
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,715
Triangle is a bit better.

706
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,255
So let's go with
the triangle.

707
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,570
So sorry for the circle.

708
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,630
Sorry for the square.

709
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,630
Let's talk about this one.

710
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,910
So if you look at this
particular image,

711
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:23,315
basically, you have
no idea what it is.

712
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,255
Exactly the same story as what

713
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,935
we had before.
But what you can

714
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:29,295
already notice is that we have

715
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:30,660
different kind of cluster,

716
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,020
which seems to be
connected, but,

717
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,940
like, still well isolated in

718
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,840
different colors.

719
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,540
So this particular piece is

720
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,145
about papers,
papers and patents,

721
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:42,785
actually. And this
was a collaboration

722
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,625
with the professor at at EPFL

723
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:46,220
working on the in the like,

724
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,760
it's a knowledge
graph really.

725
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,300
And and this field of study is

726
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,760
basically knowing,
like, innovation,

727
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,265
how and how we
relate technological

728
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:56,765
products that we have,

729
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,305
like an iPhone or anything,

730
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:00,765
to the the research
that, you know,

731
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,465
originated from,
for instance,

732
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,870
papers back in
the fifties will

733
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,730
which led to, like,
transistors,

734
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,990
screens, and so forth,

735
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,610
and to have in the end
the technological

736
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,165
products that we
have in our hand.

737
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:13,425
So all the story of
how innovation,

738
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:15,585
you know, evolves in time.

739
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:16,865
And so basically,

740
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:17,965
sorry for the French here,

741
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,280
but what you see
here is a connection

742
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,400
between patents.

743
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
So if you have
a white, border,

744
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,900
it means it's
a patent connected

745
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,980
to papers. Because
when you file

746
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,645
a patent, you
basically need to

747
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,565
do the prior art
and, you know,

748
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:32,725
you can cite other
scientific papers.

749
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,925
So it's really interesting to

750
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:37,070
see how long it takes
for a scientific

751
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,790
paper to get in per
field, you know,

752
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,550
to get cited and how long it

753
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,770
takes to get patents.

754
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,515
Sometimes you have tons of new

755
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:45,955
patents which are
not connected

756
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:47,175
to scientific papers.

757
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:48,755
So you are really wondering,

758
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:49,895
is it really innovation?

759
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,980
Is it like a radical
innovation?

760
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,140
Is it a very well
kept secret?

761
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,040
You know, so you
all these kinds

762
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,200
of questions. And as
you can see here,

763
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,795
all the nodes are lined up

764
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,315
according to the time,
basically.

765
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,015
So the the last,

766
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:06,515
state the the last
story was is,

767
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,275
on the fifties and below.

768
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,630
So it starts really, like,

769
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,550
back in the day, I would say.

770
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,330
And here it's two
thousand seventeen,

771
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:13,970
I think.

772
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,190
So this is like the when I got

773
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,725
the dataset, basically.

774
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:18,765
And you can see here,

775
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,885
this is about
computer science.

776
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:21,425
This is electronics.
This is cosmetics.

777
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:24,125
And each time you
have a different,

778
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,725
I think, thirteen different

779
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:26,785
fields of research.

780
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,190
And you can see,
like, for instance,

781
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,250
computer science, you know,

782
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,250
sites more papers and that it

783
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,450
goes deeper here.

784
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,975
So So it has more ties to

785
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:38,155
scientific research
than cosmetics,

786
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:40,375
for instance, here or it's it

787
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,215
starts to vary like very this

788
00:23:42,215 --> 00:23:44,040
is maybe the eighties and you

789
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,800
have tons of patents
and less papers.

790
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,760
And here, as you can see,

791
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,280
we have few white notes,

792
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
but tons of black
notes or black

793
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,565
borders. So it means that more

794
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,425
research than patents,
for instance.

795
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:55,925
So this is, like,
the kinds of,

796
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,765
like, knowledge that we can

797
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,305
extract from this particular,

798
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,320
not necessarily this
visualization,

799
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,140
but also the the dataset
itself.

800
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,340
It's really
interesting because

801
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,180
it is based on the the patent

802
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,275
office in Bern.

803
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:09,035
It's it has more than eighty

804
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,015
million patents.

805
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:11,195
This is, of course,

806
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,795
just a small subset where we

807
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,475
have we we actually
we make sure

808
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,235
to have also the link
to the scientific

809
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,820
papers, It's not easy to do

810
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,740
because you need to
parse, you know,

811
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,820
all the NLP natural language

812
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,420
processing to match
the authors,

813
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,860
the name, the themes
and so forth,

814
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,220
which is quite
difficult to do,

815
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,245
but really interesting as a as

816
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:29,145
a field of research.

817
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:31,225
So this is this
was one example.

818
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:33,945
Let's move on.
Let's take another

819
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,205
ask another question.

820
00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:36,960
Now we'll ask you for a color

821
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,900
and you have to
vote, you know,

822
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,980
your favorite color
green, blue,

823
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,040
yellow or red.

824
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:46,995
And, according to
your choices,

825
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,315
we're going back to
the to the piece

826
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,235
that matches what
you chose and

827
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,375
talk about it again.

828
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,270
Blue is always,
one of the, like,

829
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,530
crowd's favorite. I
think I don't know.

830
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:02,575
It's okay. I don't want to

831
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:03,615
influence any of you,

832
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:04,815
but I think that
we have a clear

833
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:06,115
winner here with the blue.

834
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,695
So even though you can you can

835
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:08,815
still change your choices,

836
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,070
but I'm not sure
we're gonna talk,

837
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,510
you know, the,
the blue choice.

838
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,470
So let's go. Let's,

839
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,090
let's talk about blue here.

840
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:18,635
This one this one is actually

841
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:20,715
I'm not sure if it's
my favorite piece,

842
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:21,775
but I think it is.

843
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,615
So this one is a very
personal story,

844
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,310
for me. But once again,

845
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,270
just think about it.

846
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,470
You have, like it seems like

847
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,390
the nodes are so
small that you

848
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,590
don't really see
them anymore.

849
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,810
You only see the edges.

850
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:35,255
You see there's like there's

851
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,655
like a a cluster at the center

852
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:38,795
with blue and red.

853
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,015
And maybe you saw
this picture.

854
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:43,015
It was, quite popular back in

855
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:45,660
in the day. This one
is about Star Wars.

856
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,000
Star Wars before
eleven, you know,

857
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,320
the new episode
seven eight nine.

858
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,665
Okay? So we forget this and we

859
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:55,605
go back to the real
star wars.

860
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,485
This is about the star
wars character.

861
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,345
Basically, what
we did here was

862
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,650
to crowd, you know,
scrape Wikipedia,

863
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,470
which is the Wikipedia of Star

864
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,030
Wars and try to
extract the the

865
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,790
all the all the characters of

866
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,975
the universe. And maybe
you're not like,

867
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,075
you know, maybe you don't,

868
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:15,635
not a diehard star
wars fan like me,

869
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:16,935
but on this Wikipedia,

870
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,755
you have more than one hundred

871
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:22,560
and sixteen thousand
pages created

872
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,500
by hand by users describing

873
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,760
the universe. It's more like

874
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,655
forty years of, you
know, data of books,

875
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:31,235
video games, comic
books, series,

876
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:32,895
everything related
to Star Wars.

877
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,495
People that make
all the description

878
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:35,160
and so forth.

879
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,040
So it's really, like,

880
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,980
very complete as
an as an archive.

881
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,325
And why is it really
important for us?

882
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:44,325
It's important
for us as humans

883
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:46,245
because all the con the corpus

884
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:47,465
here is already digitized.

885
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:48,325
It's in English.

886
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:50,345
It's quite easy to,
you know, extract.

887
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,290
Where and but the thing is if

888
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,890
we can develop the tools
to, you know,

889
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,090
match the characters and how

890
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,690
they progress in in time,

891
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,730
because you have, like,

892
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,185
star wars era
spends over thirty

893
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,365
seven thousand years.

894
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:02,985
So it's pretty big
as a universe.

895
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,645
We can develop the tools and

896
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:06,825
then apply them back
to our own history.

897
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,810
But the thing is with
our own history,

898
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,470
most of the manuscript are in

899
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,270
ancient language,

900
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,110
who are difficult to to read.

901
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,490
They are not digitized.

902
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,195
So it's it's much easier to

903
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:18,135
start first with a fictional

904
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:20,375
corpus such as this one,

905
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,275
and then go back,
develop the algorithm,

906
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:23,555
and then try to apply them,

907
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,900
on our own history.

908
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,120
This was like the motivation.

909
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,420
But the real in truth,

910
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,780
the real thing is
because I love

911
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,660
Star Wars, but, you know,

912
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,860
I have to keep appearances and

913
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,640
say that this is
really for us,

914
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:35,325
but I love Star Wars.

915
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,545
So what you see
here is a whole

916
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:38,285
different characters.

917
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,345
And for instance,
at the center,

918
00:27:40,345 --> 00:27:42,500
you have Darth Vader,
Luke Skywalker,

919
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,500
David Palpatine, Han Solo.

920
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,840
And in yellow here,

921
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
the yellow nodes
are the criminals,

922
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,880
which are actually very common

923
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,100
in the Star Wars universe.

924
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:50,975
You have Chabalahat.

925
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,115
And if you look at
his connection,

926
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:56,095
the he is mostly connected to

927
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:56,795
other villains.

928
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:58,475
So people from
the dark side of

929
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:01,540
the force in red
versus the blue one,

930
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,140
the blue guys, the republic or

931
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,580
the the jedi's and so forth.

932
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,500
So you have this, you know,

933
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,100
duality between light and dark

934
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,105
side as you can see here on on

935
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,865
the screen. Back in so when I

936
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:12,585
did this piece,

937
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:14,025
I think it was in two
thousand fifteen,

938
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,545
we had more than
twenty thousand

939
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,325
characters, but
now we introduced

940
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,620
new episodes. We have
the Mandalorian,

941
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,640
which is great,

942
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,560
with also new characters
and so forth.

943
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,580
So you can the the universe

944
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,425
expands as we
progress. Right?

945
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,085
And so we we could
redo the same

946
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:32,425
work and see how
the the the universe

947
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:33,085
would evolve.

948
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,180
So this was about Star Wars.

949
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,300
Now let's continue.
Another question.

950
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
This one is a bit tricky.

951
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,400
I'm gonna ask you
whether you want to,

952
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,465
you know, if you you feel

953
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:44,985
adventurous or not, and,

954
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:47,305
you feel like opening
a Pandora's box,

955
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:48,505
you know, I tried to come up

956
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,425
with creatives
and I and we see

957
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:52,830
people are, you know, they,

958
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,590
they want to risk
everything or they,

959
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,970
you know, they are
more careful.

960
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,590
Okay. I think
it's pretty clear

961
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,530
that you want to
see what's inside.

962
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:04,655
So yeah, I think
that there's no,

963
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:07,115
people are very,
you know, daring.

964
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:08,975
Okay, fine. So you're daring.

965
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,620
I wanna talk about
this piece here,

966
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,320
which, is also
about, you know,

967
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,200
knowledge graph.

968
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,280
And, this one, it's
it's interesting.

969
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,900
It was also made
for a company,

970
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,325
and this is about LinkedIn.

971
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:24,765
So this is what
you see here are

972
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:26,425
connections between people

973
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:27,645
connected on LinkedIn.

974
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,830
And it was really
interesting as,

975
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,990
insights because so basically

976
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,790
how you create this,

977
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,150
you go to your
connection tab,

978
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,070
you can now, everyone
can do this on.

979
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,770
You can export your data.

980
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:39,575
What I asked is, like,

981
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:40,855
the the people in the company

982
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,455
that were willing
to all of them

983
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:43,435
export this,

984
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:46,055
remove all the IDs and and and

985
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:47,435
the identifier,

986
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,710
like and try to
merge everything.

987
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,350
So we have, like,

988
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,430
the corporate network
of the people

989
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,370
working in this
particular company.

990
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,025
And what's what's
really interesting

991
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:59,565
is that we could,
you know, yeah,

992
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:00,945
let me ask you the question.

993
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:02,605
What do you do you think that

994
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,305
people are if you
work in the same

995
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,660
company, do you share the same

996
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,940
network more or less or do you

997
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,340
have your own network? Right?

998
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,620
It depends. You
would say maybe

999
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,060
if you work in
a big company or

1000
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,100
international company,

1001
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,085
you don't know
necessarily the same

1002
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:17,185
people. But in this
particular case,

1003
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:19,725
it was about, a digital agency

1004
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:20,285
in Switzerland.

1005
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,485
So I thought that
people were,

1006
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:22,365
you know, in Switzerland,

1007
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:23,090
it's quite small,

1008
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,610
so everyone will
knew each other,

1009
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,450
but it's not the case at all.

1010
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,410
What you see here,

1011
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,650
all the the the notes here at

1012
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,930
the center are the people from

1013
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,205
the company. And,

1014
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:34,385
the notes that you
see at the outside

1015
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:35,585
are their connections.

1016
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:37,325
And what we are
really interested

1017
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:39,665
in here is to see
how the percentage

1018
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:41,830
of overlap. And we found out

1019
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,610
that only six percent
of connection

1020
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,910
were shared between
the employees

1021
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,270
of the same company working in

1022
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,485
the same sector
of activity Was

1023
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:50,525
actually quite surprising.

1024
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:51,645
I thought it was, you know,

1025
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:52,605
everyone knew each other,

1026
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:53,905
but it was really
not the case.

1027
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,085
So in terms of story,

1028
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,125
it was really interesting for

1029
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,485
the company itself because now

1030
00:30:57,485 --> 00:30:59,010
you can say, look.

1031
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,410
We we bring people
from everywhere

1032
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,250
in Europe and each
time they come,

1033
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,690
they bring their
own knowledge,

1034
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,670
their own network.

1035
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,070
And, yeah, let me
show you the proof.

1036
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,195
Here it is.

1037
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,015
We also analyze like,

1038
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:12,775
like tons of different
stuff about,

1039
00:31:12,775 --> 00:31:15,115
you know, managers
and like very

1040
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:17,850
something that HR would
love to to have,

1041
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,890
and this is what we did.

1042
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,330
But I think it was striking

1043
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,470
visually to see,

1044
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,130
we see all
the different members

1045
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,570
and see all their
their connection

1046
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,870
then that we don't necessarily

1047
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,585
see tons of overlapping here.

1048
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,185
You have some small edges,

1049
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,305
but not that much.

1050
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,765
Only six percent, actually.

1051
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:33,195
So this was another,

1052
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,510
interesting project
just to show

1053
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,970
you the closed box was,

1054
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,110
exactly the same network,

1055
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,470
but the previous iteration.

1056
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,050
So it was exactly
the same network.

1057
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:44,295
But, you know, it's,

1058
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,815
this is where I started from

1059
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:47,495
this image and try
to, you know,

1060
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:48,855
expand and to create something

1061
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:49,735
a bit more crazy.

1062
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:50,695
This is, I would say,

1063
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:52,260
closer to what you
would have in,

1064
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,760
you know, abstract
modern art,

1065
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,760
and this is really
purely digital.

1066
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,160
There's no doesn't
really have any,

1067
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,075
ties to another
art or the older

1068
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:05,995
art movement. So now okay.

1069
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:07,515
As I said before,

1070
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:08,795
I wanna talk now a bit more

1071
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:09,920
because we I think
we have a bit

1072
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,980
of time. We have,

1073
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
thirteen minutes left to talk

1074
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,400
a bit more about,
AI because, okay,

1075
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,420
it's still related
to to networks.

1076
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,755
Right? But it's also
very creative.

1077
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,515
And I hope that
maybe I you know,

1078
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:23,975
if I I can,

1079
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:26,455
show you some
creative applications

1080
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:28,910
of AI, it, it makes you wonder

1081
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,590
how you can also explain that

1082
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,670
to your clients
or other partners

1083
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,350
because here we
all work in tech.

1084
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,030
But if you talk about AI for

1085
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,845
the general audience,
it's about,

1086
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:39,765
you know, terminators and that

1087
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:41,045
robots are gonna kill me.

1088
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:42,085
I'm gonna lose my job.

1089
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,865
And I want to
change this because

1090
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,740
this is not entirely true.

1091
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,320
And there's like
very good things

1092
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,400
to talk about with AI, but,

1093
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,100
and showing something
more creative,

1094
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,680
you know, it helps
people, you know,

1095
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,720
understand how it works.

1096
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,355
And they are, as once again,

1097
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:57,775
they are not frightened
by the technology

1098
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,115
and they want to embrace it.

1099
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:00,475
And I think that's
a message in

1100
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:01,435
terms of impact,

1101
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:02,540
it's much more powerful.

1102
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,100
So something that
you're also very,

1103
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,480
like, it's very common.

1104
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,560
It's using
generative adversarial

1105
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,420
networks, GANs,

1106
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,420
to synthesize new images such

1107
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,665
as this one. If you
go to this website,

1108
00:33:13,665 --> 00:33:14,945
this person does not exist.

1109
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:16,405
Basically, each
time you refresh

1110
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:17,685
refresh the page,

1111
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,345
you would synthesize
a new face,

1112
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,420
which is almost, like,
photorealistic.

1113
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,440
Here, the hearing
is a bit, weird,

1114
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
but I think new iteration,

1115
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,520
if you get lucky,

1116
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,040
you cannot
distinguish the real

1117
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,435
from fake. So, basically,

1118
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:31,715
you have a a network that

1119
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:33,155
synthesize fake images,

1120
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:34,915
and another network
tries to to

1121
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:36,675
check whether this
image is real

1122
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:39,000
or fake. And once
it's trained,

1123
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,360
then the network cannot make

1124
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,800
the difference
between real like

1125
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,720
training data or fake data.

1126
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,240
And this is where this is how

1127
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,795
you can create some, like,

1128
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:48,315
photo realistic image.

1129
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,875
Now this is not
very creative.

1130
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,335
This is about face synthesis.

1131
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,315
So how can we use the same

1132
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,095
technology to to
create something

1133
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,200
more interesting?

1134
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,260
I will first ask you to vote

1135
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,240
whether you are more
a micro or macro.

1136
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,400
So let's see.

1137
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,760
Okay. If other
people will have

1138
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,640
the chance to, you know,

1139
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,260
change their answers or not.

1140
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:26,475
Okay. Well, I think we we all

1141
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:28,495
agree on Macron now,
so let let's go.

1142
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,490
Now if I if I had
to tell you if I,

1143
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,570
in fact, told you that
you can actually,

1144
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:38,005
train a network on a thousand

1145
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:38,725
different objects,

1146
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:40,265
and then you can compose them

1147
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,245
to synthesize a combination of

1148
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:43,580
the object that you see.

1149
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,260
Now that you have
this particular

1150
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,220
image and you have, like,

1151
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,460
a weight of fifty two percent

1152
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,800
for a mask, a crab, gorilla,

1153
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,035
space shuttle,
birdhouse, coral reef.

1154
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,555
You know, all
these ingredients

1155
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:55,275
that you see here,

1156
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:56,475
you can combine them to and

1157
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,175
synthesize
a combination of them.

1158
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,475
So just look at all
the ingredients

1159
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,180
that you see here
and trying to

1160
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,320
imagine something.

1161
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,800
I think it's gonna be
pretty difficult.

1162
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,700
I'm not even sure
if you know,

1163
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,620
I like I don't even know what

1164
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,225
what this was or, you know,

1165
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:13,465
But this is what
the the power of AI.

1166
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:14,825
This is where we can use it as

1167
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:15,885
a tool to, you know,

1168
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,945
sparkle creativity and get

1169
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:19,225
surprised by the results.

1170
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:21,370
So, basically I
combined the old,

1171
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,370
all these ingredients and this

1172
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,050
is the result. And to me,

1173
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,650
this looks like
a more like a macro

1174
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,130
shot, you know,

1175
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,410
of something that it's both

1176
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,355
insectoid and our same
time, like plant,

1177
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:32,815
you know, vegetable
or something

1178
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:34,895
organic at the same time.

1179
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,035
So you can create
very abstract

1180
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,180
shapes as well. Right?

1181
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,100
We saw like very
realistic faces,

1182
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,860
but it's all about
the training

1183
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,700
data and how you combine all

1184
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,380
the elements. So this is,

1185
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,205
this was a still image with

1186
00:35:47,205 --> 00:35:48,085
the different elements.

1187
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:49,865
Now I'm gonna show you videos

1188
00:35:50,245 --> 00:35:52,085
and see how you
can evolve and,

1189
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,285
you know, make this whole

1190
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,905
animation go very smooth.

1191
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,460
So but first, I
have to ask you,

1192
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,260
you know, the drill.

1193
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,020
Once again,
whether you're more

1194
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,960
like the sea person
or land person.

1195
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:05,915
Oh, it's funny.

1196
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,435
You know, most of
the time, people,

1197
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:10,075
like, choose the sea, but,

1198
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:12,815
it seems like we have
land people here.

1199
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,860
So you're more, you know,

1200
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,560
far from the sea. So okay.

1201
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,320
Maybe I'll let
you guys vote to

1202
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,635
change your mortgage.
So let it is.

1203
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:28,795
So I'm gonna this
is a it's a video

1204
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:29,995
synthesized with AI.

1205
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:31,850
So I'm gonna mute
myself and, you know,

1206
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,010
pass the the the it has some

1207
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,950
custom music made
for the video.

1208
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,330
It's on YouTube.

1209
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,010
You can also watch
this at the end,

1210
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,050
like, on your own.

1211
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:42,985
Try to to see if it works.

1212
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:44,885
The full video is in four k at

1213
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:46,185
sixty frames per second,

1214
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,105
so it's pretty nice
as a resolution.

1215
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:50,825
Let me try to to
play it to you now.

1216
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,140
Alright. So this, video,

1217
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,540
is called and
this animation is

1218
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,320
called evade
evading confinement

1219
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,715
or lockdown. This was created

1220
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,475
at the beginning
of, lockdown.

1221
00:38:06,475 --> 00:38:08,795
So the idea was, you
know, to create,

1222
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:10,795
surreal landscapes
and then move

1223
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,335
according to your
mood, basically.

1224
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,300
All of so the quality was not

1225
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,940
really great, but,

1226
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,780
if you watch it on
YouTube on your own,

1227
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,120
I think that would
be much better.

1228
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,040
But you see how
smooth the transition

1229
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,625
were because you can really

1230
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,985
synthesize all
the intermediate

1231
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:25,585
image images that
you need just

1232
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:27,905
by moving the weight
just a tiny

1233
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,940
fraction. And and so that it

1234
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,340
makes very nice,
animations over time,

1235
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,400
which I really like.

1236
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
So this was
an example of a video

1237
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,440
made with AI.

1238
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,675
This is like another, like,

1239
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:40,275
the other choices
that you didn't

1240
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,635
select. As you can see here,

1241
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:42,935
you have the abiding
confinement.

1242
00:38:42,995 --> 00:38:45,140
This was projected on in Paris

1243
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,080
in e p seven,

1244
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,200
which is like a a hyperbar you

1245
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
see on the on the wall.

1246
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,160
So it's pretty
big and was more

1247
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,905
than fifteen meters,

1248
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,765
wide and ten meters tall.

1249
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,185
And so it was that displayed

1250
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:58,305
here for ten days.

1251
00:38:58,305 --> 00:38:59,425
It was pretty good, you know,

1252
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:00,705
to have the also feedback,

1253
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,305
people asking me
what it was about.

1254
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,570
And, you know, once again,

1255
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,870
doing my science,

1256
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,170
work and talk about how it's

1257
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,370
made with AI. You see it's

1258
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,850
nonthreatening. It's cool and

1259
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,135
technology and so forth.

1260
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,975
And people were
really happy at

1261
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,435
the end instead
of just having,

1262
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:17,495
it's gonna replace you,

1263
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:18,615
your job and so forth.

1264
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,855
So I try to to
emphasize and and

1265
00:39:20,855 --> 00:39:22,660
show the positive outcomes of

1266
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,020
technology instead
of, you know,

1267
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,880
just pointing out to
to the negative.

1268
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,160
So that this is like a small

1269
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:31,405
video to to have an idea what

1270
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:32,325
it would look like.

1271
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:36,425
So but, yeah, to sit
in this piece here.

1272
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:37,765
There was no sound, though.

1273
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:41,440
It was a bit shame,
but, it's okay.

1274
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,700
So another application that we

1275
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,220
can create with AI is that now

1276
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
we can get inspired
by the shapes

1277
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,555
that are generated
by the machine and,

1278
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,075
you know, going
back to inspire

1279
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:53,915
the database part or
the data art part.

1280
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,115
And this is what I did here.

1281
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:56,635
You see, this is to me,

1282
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:58,860
it looks like
a flower bouquet.

1283
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,760
Right? But but it was really

1284
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,280
inspired by it
because I saw my

1285
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
network was synthesizing
these shapes.

1286
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,480
And I I realized, okay,

1287
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,865
maybe I should try
to, you know,

1288
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:09,045
take this knowledge,
graph this network,

1289
00:40:09,185 --> 00:40:11,105
and try to change
it so that it

1290
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:13,285
will look like
a flower bouquet.

1291
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,680
And you can zoom in here.

1292
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,980
Each dot is a person,

1293
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,780
and they are are
connected to to their,

1294
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,000
hierarchy to to their
boss, basically.

1295
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,545
So this is about
a whole group.

1296
00:40:23,545 --> 00:40:25,225
This is like the global CEO,

1297
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:26,665
and you have
the top executive,

1298
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:28,105
and then you can actually go

1299
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,625
down the hierarchy
to the intern

1300
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,560
of the intern of
the intern and

1301
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,440
at the top here.

1302
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,200
And instead of
having, you know,

1303
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,140
something top down,
I'm the boss.

1304
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,420
You are my employees.

1305
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,805
The idea here was
was as a CEO,

1306
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,265
I let my, you know,

1307
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:44,805
my what we do together makes,

1308
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:47,045
we grow as, as a company,

1309
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,245
but also as human beings.

1310
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,670
So this is more like a flower

1311
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,830
like shape instead of being,

1312
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,210
something very hierarchical.

1313
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,230
This was, like,

1314
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,270
the artistic idea
behind the, the piece,

1315
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,270
but it was really
influenced by AI.

1316
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,985
So this is how to go back to

1317
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:02,665
the to the knowledge
graphs and

1318
00:41:02,665 --> 00:41:03,325
so forth.

1319
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,105
So I think we have
we have a bit

1320
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,385
of time. I think
I want to show

1321
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:08,825
you one last, surprise.

1322
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:10,750
We have four minutes
because, you know,

1323
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,170
what what have been presenting

1324
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,690
so far is really
based on math.

1325
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,450
Right? You have
either for deep

1326
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,850
learning or visualization or

1327
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,535
knowledge in itself,
knowledge graphs.

1328
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:20,975
This is about, you know,

1329
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:23,395
doing layouts and
stuff about math.

1330
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:25,695
So I have a an example
to show you,

1331
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:27,180
something that you are all

1332
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,620
familiar with, I
think, in theory,

1333
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,900
but you are maybe not that

1334
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,000
familiar with
the recent advances

1335
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,140
of of this. So I want to talk

1336
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,280
about fractal art.

1337
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:36,685
You know, this is like very

1338
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:38,525
something that we
see quite often.

1339
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,805
This is the Mandelbrot set.

1340
00:41:39,805 --> 00:41:41,645
So a fractal is
a shape made of

1341
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:43,645
parts similar to
the whole in some way.

1342
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:45,105
This is
the official definition

1343
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:47,250
and fractals are
really omnipresent

1344
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,150
in nature. It
could be in leaves

1345
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,830
and your heartbeat
and crystals

1346
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,550
and vegetables
and mountains and

1347
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,695
snowflakes, like
everything is fractal.

1348
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,135
So this is what
we have, like,

1349
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:58,755
a standard modern broad set.

1350
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,255
But the software that we have

1351
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:02,495
now is really powerful and can

1352
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:04,735
create very different
looking shape.

1353
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:06,270
And to prove that to you,

1354
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,870
I will ask you to, you know,

1355
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,870
pick a side and choose whether

1356
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,470
you are more like
an organic or

1357
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,215
geometric guy and
and see if you

1358
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:15,675
are surprised by the results.

1359
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:22,360
So, okay.

1360
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,340
So it's almost fifty fifty,

1361
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,100
but we we can have
more people.

1362
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,220
I think we can have ten more

1363
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,395
people voting. So organic.

1364
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:31,055
So you are very, like,

1365
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:33,295
interested in knowing
how something so,

1366
00:42:33,295 --> 00:42:34,835
like, mathematic and geometric

1367
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:36,655
could be more looks like more

1368
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:42,450
organic maybe. So
let me oblige this.

1369
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,230
This is a fractal.

1370
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,495
This is pure math,

1371
00:42:45,735 --> 00:42:46,775
mathematical function.

1372
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,375
And to me, it looks
like a virus,

1373
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,815
you know, and it's was created

1374
00:42:49,815 --> 00:42:52,055
during the coronavirus time.

1375
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:52,935
You can all, like,

1376
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:54,215
see that it's
a fractal because

1377
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:55,300
at the at the edges here,

1378
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,900
you see that it
repeats and repeats,

1379
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
it repeats, but at
the same time,

1380
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,180
it looks very, you know,

1381
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,620
around and something that you

1382
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,380
could almost find in the,

1383
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,360
under a microscope,

1384
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:06,265
but it's just
pure mathematical

1385
00:43:06,405 --> 00:43:09,065
functions. Another
example here,

1386
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:11,790
this called this one
is called a brief.

1387
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,850
So it's about,
the virus as well.

1388
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,590
And here, it's actually
data fractal.

1389
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,110
So it was created five months

1390
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,615
after the the initial
COVID you know,

1391
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:22,735
announcement.
And you have five

1392
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:24,835
ring one, two, three,
four, five rings.

1393
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,015
And the cool thing about this

1394
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,015
fractal is like
now we are almost

1395
00:43:28,015 --> 00:43:29,960
a year in the pandemic,
so I can,

1396
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,560
you know, change
the camera and

1397
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,960
create more and
more you know,

1398
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,800
circle like shape like this so

1399
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,960
I can actually
make it move over

1400
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,575
time And to me,
it looks like,

1401
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,175
you know, blood flow and kind

1402
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:42,635
of like oxygen stuff.

1403
00:43:42,855 --> 00:43:44,775
So, this was the idea
behind the piece,

1404
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:46,235
and I always try
to incorporate

1405
00:43:46,295 --> 00:43:48,820
some small data so that it has

1406
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,320
more connected to
the data art realm.

1407
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,040
Lastly, I want to show
you this example,

1408
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:55,515
which is also a fractal,

1409
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:56,795
but to me looks like more like

1410
00:43:56,795 --> 00:43:58,475
a sandstorm. And this was like

1411
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,395
a three d render,
the three d fractal,

1412
00:44:00,395 --> 00:44:02,670
but the render
itself is almost,

1413
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,290
grainy with particles.

1414
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,190
And the old to me almost look

1415
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,150
like like a sense storm,

1416
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,510
something you would
see in the mummy

1417
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,195
or dune or something
like this.

1418
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,355
But once again,
this is just pure,

1419
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:14,355
math. So I wanted to show you

1420
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:15,795
the contrast
between, you know,

1421
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:17,475
what we think a fractal is in

1422
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:19,400
the Mandelbrot
set and something

1423
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,220
we can which can
be very organic.

1424
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,600
So to,

1425
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,565
to con I have one
more video to

1426
00:44:27,685 --> 00:44:29,525
show you. And, so this one is

1427
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:33,225
a combination of
fractal and, data.

1428
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,140
So I'm gonna talk over it.

1429
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,060
What you see here
is the fractal

1430
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,820
that moves according
to the increase

1431
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,720
of sea level,

1432
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,520
and the data comes
from the NASA.

1433
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:46,795
So as the sea level
rises, we see that,

1434
00:44:47,115 --> 00:44:48,795
the shape at the the center

1435
00:44:48,795 --> 00:44:50,155
starts to grow, grow, grow,

1436
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,075
and if it grows too
much, then it will,

1437
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:53,295
like, basically explode.

1438
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,250
So this is what you see here.

1439
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,590
And you also can notice that

1440
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,510
camera itself seems like to be

1441
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,910
zooming in and
out very slowly,

1442
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,915
and this camera
movement is also,

1443
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,395
matches the tide in France and

1444
00:45:09,395 --> 00:45:10,355
some particular dates.

1445
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:12,530
So I try to
parameterize everything

1446
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,610
that you see here according to

1447
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,610
data and try to, you know,

1448
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,450
use the this message
to, you know,

1449
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,390
warn about the sea
level increase.

1450
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:22,495
So something that
is we are all,

1451
00:45:23,115 --> 00:45:24,315
we're all in this together.

1452
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:27,115
So this is what
the the main idea,

1453
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:32,780
and as we go back,
then we smiled.

1454
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,900
It's a fractal animation.

1455
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,660
So this is my as
I said before,

1456
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,200
try to influence both,

1457
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,865
merge two ramps of
data and art at,

1458
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:43,125
in, unexpected ways.

1459
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:45,365
So to to conclude
this presentation,

1460
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,265
I'm gonna I'm
gonna ask you one

1461
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:48,645
last question,

1462
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,350
and then we're gonna
maybe have time to,

1463
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,310
to take some questions.

1464
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,830
So basically just to let you

1465
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,190
know that creativity
is the most

1466
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,390
demanded soft skills of two

1467
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,495
twelve twenty twenty and was

1468
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:00,195
also the same, last year.

1469
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:01,855
So if you are guys
are interested

1470
00:46:01,855 --> 00:46:03,375
to learning how
to do stuff like

1471
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,795
this data art, I have
a YouTube channel,

1472
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,100
and I also, you know,

1473
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,620
you can connect with me on

1474
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,460
different social media, and,

1475
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,145
I'll be happy to,
to to talk it.

1476
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,785
So to conclude art upsets and

1477
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:17,765
science reassures.

1478
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:19,445
I hope that you liked
this presentation.

1479
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,245
If you have any
questions, thank you.

1480
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:32,715
I think we have
some questions.

1481
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:36,075
Yes. Kiran, can
you hear me? Yes.

1482
00:46:36,455 --> 00:46:37,815
Okay. Great. Yes.

1483
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:39,790
We do have, unfortunately,

1484
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,390
we don't have as much time as

1485
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,070
we'd like to because
we're already

1486
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,830
a bit over. But there is one

1487
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,510
specific question
asked by Michiel,

1488
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,870
who's also one of our speakers

1489
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,795
that I just have to
address to you.

1490
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,855
So, his question is,

1491
00:46:51,855 --> 00:46:53,455
how can a little bit of FARC

1492
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:55,155
help in the process
of designing

1493
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:56,815
commercial
applications powered

1494
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:57,680
by knowledge graphs?

1495
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,880
It's a very specific
one because

1496
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,020
this is what he does.

1497
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,160
So, he said that for
their customers,

1498
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,840
it's often difficult
to imagine

1499
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,620
that the different
types of entities,

1500
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:08,615
allow different, and
new perspectives.

1501
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:11,075
Do you have any advice on how

1502
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:12,055
to trigger that?

1503
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:13,655
It's a difficult question.

1504
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,160
How can a little bit of I see

1505
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,440
it in chat handling process of

1506
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,680
designing. Well,

1507
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,880
it's really about the message

1508
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,160
you want to
communicate. Right?

1509
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,545
So it's difficult
to automatize

1510
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:23,965
the art creation part.

1511
00:47:23,965 --> 00:47:25,245
Unfortunately, I
don't I don't have,

1512
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,365
like, a premade algorithm.

1513
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:27,665
I click and it's beautiful.

1514
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:30,440
But I think it it goes back to

1515
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,320
the story, right?

1516
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,180
If you can convey
a bit of emotion,

1517
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,920
then your brain,

1518
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,280
basically the knowledge graph

1519
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,480
is read the left
side of the brain,

1520
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,600
right? You about the logic,

1521
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,865
rationality, and so forth.

1522
00:47:39,865 --> 00:47:41,785
If you trigger
hard in the right

1523
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:43,805
side about knowledge
about emotions,

1524
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:46,185
and basically you
combine both of them,

1525
00:47:46,185 --> 00:47:47,545
the feeling it's
much stronger.

1526
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:49,080
So So you can use
that as a way

1527
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,080
to convey that
your solution is

1528
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,980
very interesting.

1529
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,220
It offers new perspective
and so forth.

1530
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,355
But, it's not easy to do.

1531
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:58,635
We need to, you know,

1532
00:47:58,635 --> 00:48:00,255
hand it's something
as a handmade

1533
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:03,790
for so far. Yeah.
That makes sense.

1534
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,110
Okay. Well, we'll we'll
have to wrap up,

1535
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,630
because otherwise,

1536
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,750
we'll be eating into the time

1537
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,630
of our next keynote,

1538
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,930
which is also very
interesting,

1539
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,555
which is done by Iran Avidan,

1540
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:16,335
from Intel. So
our operator will

1541
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:17,375
wrap up this session.

1542
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:19,375
We'll keep your questions and

1543
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:21,330
try to address
them to offline.

1544
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,190
So thanks once again, Kiel,

1545
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,910
then onwards with
the rest of the event.

1546
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,410
See you. Thank you
very much, guys,

1547
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,026
and I hope you liked
it. See you soon.

1548
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:31,512
Cheers.
