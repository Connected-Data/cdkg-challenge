00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello, and welcome
welcome back,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,660
everyone, to
Knowledge Connections

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,700
twenty twenty.

4
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:12,455
I'm Jozana Diotis, and,

5
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,415
I'm your host here
on the Innovators

6
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:16,915
track. And,

7
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:19,335
we keep we keep
pushing through

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,150
with more great talks.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,130
We're here today with,

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,610
Juan Sequeira and Brian Jacob

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,895
from data dot org.

12
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,635
Who are here to
talk to us about

13
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:32,275
data catalogs,
knowledge graphs,

14
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,195
and how these two
are connected,

15
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,570
and how you can use knowledge

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,190
graphs to to power your data.

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,910
The floor is yours,
Juan and Brian.

18
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,285
Take it away. Great.

19
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,265
Thank you very much, George,

20
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:47,965
and we're excited to be here.

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,410
So, this talk when
when we wanted

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,450
to have a talk here,

23
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,150
Brian and I were
thinking about

24
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,455
something to be having
a a a different

25
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:00,735
bold point of view,

26
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,575
and and that's the goal
of this talk.

27
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,050
So, just a little
bit about us.

28
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,730
My name is Juan Cicada.

29
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,090
I'm I'm
the principal scientist

30
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,230
at data dot world.

31
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,890
I've been in this,

32
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,750
knowledge graph space,

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,045
which goes back
to the original

34
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:16,565
semantic web vision for almost

35
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,485
fifteen years. This is where I

36
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:19,925
started doing my
research, and I have,

37
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,525
I did my PhD at the University

38
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:22,585
of Texas at Austin.

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,820
We spun out our research into

40
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,900
a company called
CapCenta, which we did,

41
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,980
kind of pioneered
a lot of the semantic

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,740
graph virtualization
on relational

43
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,995
databases, developed Grapho,

44
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,335
our visual collaborative real

45
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:35,935
time knowledge graph
scheme editor.

46
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,615
And and we we sold
the company.

47
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:39,970
We're acquired by by
Brian's company,

48
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,610
data dot world,

49
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,370
and I've been part of kind of

50
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,730
bridging the world between

51
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,270
academic and industry,

52
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,845
being on many
standards committees,

53
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,445
and and now working
on the property

54
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:49,825
graph schema working group.

55
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:51,565
And, I'll pass it on to Brian

56
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:53,540
to introduce himself. Great.

57
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,360
Thanks, Juan.

58
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,340
I as Juan said,

59
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm the the one of
the cofounders,

60
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,300
the CTO for data dot world.

61
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,940
I I think, you know,

62
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,715
maybe my story is
a little bit similar,

63
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:02,675
but inverted to one's.

64
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,355
I, you know, grad
school twenty

65
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,775
years ago in AI
machine learning,

66
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:08,355
but really have spent the last

67
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:10,050
twenty years, you know,

68
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,410
starting and working
for a number

69
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,850
of of large
companies kinda more

70
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,230
in mainstream
data management.

71
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,650
And the idea behind data dot

72
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,930
world was to really
bring the power

73
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,355
of semantic web and knowledge

74
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:19,795
graph technology
into that world.

75
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:21,715
And so, that's how
I got connected

76
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:23,015
up with Juan and ultimately,

77
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,235
acquired his company
so that, you know,

78
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,595
we can kinda work
on this together.

79
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,460
So And this is a side note I

80
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,260
always tell people.

81
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,880
Brian at HomeAway,

82
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,440
there that was a company that

83
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,100
acquired over thirty companies

84
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,225
in ten years. So if there's

85
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:37,425
somebody who knows about data

86
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,265
integration, it's
Brian Jacob.

87
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,865
He has integrated over thirty

88
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:43,205
different systems
in just ten years.

89
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,340
That's people
spend integrating

90
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,160
one two different systems in

91
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,800
just two years.

92
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,500
So to take that in account.

93
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,695
So this is this is the kind of

94
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,215
your typical example
that you see.

95
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,775
Right? You have your
sources. Right?

96
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,235
And you have your
data producers,

97
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,560
the personas, like
data engineers

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
and data stewards.

99
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,640
They have all this
data from all

100
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,540
these different sources.

101
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,960
And the goal is to be able to

102
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
integrate this data,

103
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,520
to be able to
provide it to your

104
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,320
consumers of data,

105
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,755
like your data
analysts and your

106
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,955
data scientists who wanna be

107
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,115
able to go answer
your questions.

108
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,795
Right? And there's
this big gap.

109
00:03:12,795 --> 00:03:15,435
And the typical
marketing or or

110
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:16,430
architecture slides,

111
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,470
it's that you put a knowledge

112
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,610
graph here in the middle.

113
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,730
But in reality,

114
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,190
what you start
seeing in here,

115
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,465
there's very specific
boxes. Right?

116
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,425
There's things like we need to

117
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:26,305
do data governance.

118
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,225
We need to have
a a business glossary,

119
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,045
a data glossary.

120
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,805
We need to have
data virtualization

121
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,325
and federation technology.

122
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,930
We need to do data quality.

123
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,150
We need to do data security,

124
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,890
data preparation,
data lineage,

125
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,210
data dot dot dot data,
more data data.

126
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,570
Tomorrow, there's
gonna be more

127
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,590
data things that
we need to go do.

128
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,815
And all these
different aspects

129
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,395
are needed to be able to go

130
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,295
integrate data.

131
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,595
So just simply kinda
slapping on that,

132
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,195
oh, a knowledge graph is gonna

133
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:52,800
solve us here. The devil's in

134
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,720
the details, and there's a lot

135
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
of details in here.

136
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
And this is the big
question is

137
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,780
how do you figure
out what you need?

138
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,545
Our position is that you wanna

139
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:04,965
start on two
important pillars.

140
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,605
The first is
a pillar on metadata

141
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:10,880
management, and
the next is a pillar

142
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,160
on data management.

143
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,140
So you want to
be able to start

144
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,500
build your strong
foundation on

145
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,940
top of metadata management and

146
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,625
data management,

147
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:19,705
And that is our definition of

148
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:21,325
what a data catalog
should be.

149
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,785
Now a data catalog wants need

150
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:25,065
you need to be able to go do

151
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,720
things with quality
and security

152
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,180
and preparation and so forth.

153
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,020
But depending on
your use case,

154
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
data quality may
be more important

155
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,740
than data lineage.

156
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
Data preparation might be more

157
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,540
important than data security.

158
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,245
So that's why you
don't need to

159
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,005
really think about
boiling the ocean

160
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,785
and bringing all these
things together.

161
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,125
You wanna start on these very

162
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,645
important pillars
and then bring

163
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,425
in the other tools
that you need.

164
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,670
And how do you bring in these

165
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,990
other tools? The
knowledge graph

166
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,430
is what really
helps put to put

167
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,490
this stuff in together.

168
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,910
Because what we're gonna go

169
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,365
discuss here is that because

170
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,965
everything is driven
by connections,

171
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:58,205
and and and we
can start putting

172
00:04:58,525 --> 00:04:59,565
connecting all these different

173
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,165
systems together to ultimately

174
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:02,750
be able to create your
knowledge graph.

175
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,870
So I've introduced
two terms here,

176
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,550
data catalog and
the knowledge graph.

177
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,630
A data catalog is
a metadata and

178
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,665
data management
tool that helps

179
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,965
users inventory
and organize and

180
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,505
access the data within
their systems.

181
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:17,005
And the knowledge graph,

182
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:18,205
I know there are just so many

183
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,725
different definitions
and stuff,

184
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,920
and and and this is
what I call Juan's,

185
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,080
nonscientific, non pedantic

186
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,680
definition of
a knowledge graph.

187
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,040
You wanna do data integration

188
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,445
where you're
integrating internal

189
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,205
and also external
data sources.

190
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,185
And second is that
you want your

191
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,705
real world concepts and

192
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,545
relationships to
be first class

193
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,040
citizens, And
those concepts end

194
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,640
up being nodes in a graph,

195
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
and the relations that end up

196
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
being edges in the graph.

197
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,280
And that's a simple definition

198
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,875
of what a knowledge graph is.

199
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:46,955
So with that,
let me go pass it

200
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,475
on to Brian because I want him

201
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,995
to go tell us why your data

202
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:51,675
catalog should be
powered by a knowledge

203
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:55,220
graph. So I'm gonna start by

204
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,840
talking about the relationship

205
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,700
in this direction.

206
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,860
The data catalog is powered by

207
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,760
your knowledge graph.

208
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,515
So a graph data model
is, by definition,

209
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:04,855
flexible and agile.

210
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,555
It's about entities
and relationships,

211
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,615
and it can be open open world

212
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:09,815
in the sense that
you can bring

213
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:11,275
in new entities and
relationships.

214
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,130
So that as you
move across your

215
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,370
organization, acquire
new data sources,

216
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,670
uncover new data sources,

217
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,810
you can bring those
into the model

218
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,950
in a flexible way.

219
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,325
Data quality,
security, lineage,

220
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,185
all of these kind of use cases

221
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:26,005
of of a metadata management

222
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,085
system are represented
in the knowledge

223
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:29,945
graph as relationships between

224
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,690
the between entities.

225
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,110
And it's you know,

226
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,230
as with any application,

227
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,150
it's not that you can't build

228
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,755
this application on
top of tabular,

229
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,715
you know, relational
SQL databases.

230
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,695
It's that when you think about

231
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,135
the kind of expansiveness and

232
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,240
the openness of
this problem by

233
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,920
modeling it at
where the entities

234
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,200
and the relationships
are first

235
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,020
class citizens,

236
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,440
you end up putting the data,

237
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,960
the actual meaning
of what you're

238
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,485
representing first,

239
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,265
and you build
a more flexible,

240
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,505
usable, and and and powerful

241
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,065
implementation to
power discovery,

242
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,470
search, recommendations across

243
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,450
those data assets.

244
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,190
And and one thing
to add here,

245
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,890
if you look at
other companies,

246
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,045
like the Airbnbs
of the world,

247
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,245
right, that they
built their own

248
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,065
data catalogs,

249
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,005
guess what they built
the catalog on?

250
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:20,025
They built it on
graphs. Sure.

251
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,570
So thinking about
the use cases

252
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,930
that we talked about for for

253
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,130
data catalog, for metadata

254
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,030
management system.

255
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,370
For when when you think about

256
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,330
the first thing
you wanna think

257
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,935
about is cataloging
your data assets.

258
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:31,695
What data assets do exist and

259
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,235
how are they related
to one another?

260
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:35,455
This is this could
be represented by,

261
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,695
you know, by go back
one one slide one.

262
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:39,500
This represented
by, you know,

263
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,860
thinking about those database

264
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,540
tables and databases as nodes

265
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,000
in the graph and
the relationship

266
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,380
of containment as
as a relationship

267
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,200
between them.

268
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,535
Going forward to discovery,

269
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,215
you wanna understand what data

270
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,735
assets are related
to a topic,

271
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,310
what physical assets like this

272
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,670
table are related to,

273
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,510
what logical concepts
like the concept

274
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,430
of order from my
business glossary

275
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,370
or from my taxonomy
of my organization.

276
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,065
You wanna think
about governance.

277
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,905
You wanna understand
what agents

278
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:07,105
and policies are related to

279
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:07,825
those data assets.

280
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:08,305
You know, again,

281
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:09,605
here is a simple example.

282
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,930
Reuben is a person
who is the steward

283
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,730
of this database.

284
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,190
Notice how each of
these statements

285
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,170
are a real world use case of

286
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,630
something I'd like
to understand,

287
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,715
but they are but but
but, ultimately,

288
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,375
they are represented
by modeling

289
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,455
the entities and
the relationships

290
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:24,735
as first class
citizen just like

291
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,355
in any graph based solution.

292
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,910
Provenance. How
are data assets

293
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,750
related to one another and and

294
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,670
over time and and and in a in

295
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,910
a derivation, in
a in a, you know,

296
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,835
in a state change
representation manner.

297
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:41,475
And collaboration.

298
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,735
What people are related to all

299
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:46,355
the data and
analytical artifacts?

300
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
If I want to understand all of

301
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
the data
the the the data assets

302
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
in my system,
it's one thing to

303
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,960
have kind of all
the relate all

304
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
the all the data
represented in

305
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,925
the catalog, but
you also wanna

306
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:56,965
understand who are the other

307
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,805
people who have
additional information,

308
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,485
who have actually
where is the prior

309
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,325
art and how who
else can I contact

310
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:03,525
who has actually touched this

311
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,770
data or has has a relationship

312
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,810
These things, these are all

313
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,090
concepts in the real world?

314
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,870
Your databases, your reports,

315
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:15,605
your your your
policies and people,

316
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,065
they're all real
world concepts.

317
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,805
They contain information about

318
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:20,245
other real world concepts and

319
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:21,980
relationships, but
they themselves

320
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,720
are concepts that
have relationships

321
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
to one another and
the information

322
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,820
they represent.

323
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Regardless of how you actually

324
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,480
implement it,
your data catalog

325
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,375
is a knowledge graph.

326
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:32,455
It's a graph of of of of of

327
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,315
knowledge about these assets,

328
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:35,895
and it should be the starting

329
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,575
point for your enterprise

330
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:38,535
knowledge graph that kind of

331
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:39,870
speaks in the domain language

332
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,610
of your business.

333
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,270
So stepping through those use

334
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,335
cases again. You know, first,

335
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,615
I represent that this orders

336
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,375
table is part of
this particular

337
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,055
database. I
understand that that

338
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,595
orders table is
related logically

339
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:54,030
to the concept of orders.

340
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,690
I understand that
Ruben is the steward

341
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,070
of the sales database and that

342
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,590
there's a net sales
table derived

343
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,530
from that orders
table and a report

344
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,890
derived from that,

345
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:07,605
which was actually
produced by by Sally.

346
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,285
I all of these individual

347
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:11,025
statements are things that are

348
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,140
collected together
by introspecting

349
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,740
and understanding the metadata

350
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,820
about about these
data assets.

351
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
And these give
you when you ping

352
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,180
them bring them all together,

353
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,375
a graph over which
you can reason

354
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,535
and analyze your
data infrastructure

355
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,695
to understand where
where the where

356
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,510
where the actual data and know

357
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,270
and information
about your real

358
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,570
world entities lives.

359
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,455
So when you build this graph,

360
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:37,895
ultimately, you need a model

361
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,595
that helps you make
sense of this.

362
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,255
Your nodes are gonna represent

363
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:43,255
concepts like data
assets, databases,

364
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,790
tables, and columns,
the agents,

365
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,770
topics, etcetera.

366
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,510
The edges are gonna represent

367
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,490
things like containment,

368
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,970
things like like
logical relation,

369
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,550
things like derivation for

370
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,690
provenance and lineage.

371
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,085
And so what you
end up what you

372
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,485
end up with is
an ontology that

373
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:01,205
describes these that this this

374
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:03,545
interconnected network of of

375
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,560
data assets, of
your of of the of

376
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,260
the metadata about
your data assets.

377
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,160
What we what we have built

378
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,280
internally is not told you we

379
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,825
call Dweck, but, ultimately,

380
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,965
it is the majority of that of

381
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,325
that is vocabulary from these

382
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:15,965
open standards.

383
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:17,405
It uses things like DCAP for

384
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:18,785
the basic catalog structure,

385
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Dublin Core for basic,

386
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
metadata about
digital assets,

387
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,580
Provo for lineage,
SCOS for concepts,

388
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
etcetera. The this is the this

389
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,855
is the ontology that you start

390
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,615
with to make sense of the data

391
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:31,515
assets themselves,

392
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:32,855
and it builds into the next

393
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,055
section that Juan
is gonna talk

394
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,335
about where you actually then

395
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,560
use that as the foundation to

396
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,840
build your
enterprise knowledge

397
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,120
graph that's in
the language of

398
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,180
your of your business.

399
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,740
And I'll just kind
of close with,

400
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,975
you know, thinking about one

401
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:46,255
specific use case and how this

402
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,535
kinda really makes it makes it

403
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:49,075
makes it real,
makes it visceral.

404
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:50,895
You know, a a common use case

405
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:52,835
for a data catalog
is to understand

406
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,210
lineage for things
like impact analysis.

407
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,510
And when you when
you do that,

408
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,630
what you're really
doing is saying,

409
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,990
I want to go into
the graph that

410
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,270
represents all
the ways that all

411
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,810
of my data assets
are interrelated,

412
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,715
and I wanna pull
out a subgraph

413
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,615
that looks at the looks at all

414
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:09,355
of these things
by along the the

415
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,710
derived from dimension.

416
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,070
I wanna basically pull out all

417
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,590
of the the ways
that things are

418
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,630
derived from in a prominent

419
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,070
sense so that I
look all the way

420
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,270
off to the right
here and say,

421
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,855
I have these several
Tableau reports,

422
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,195
and I would like to understand

423
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:24,695
where the data
that powers these

424
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:25,735
reports come from.

425
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,015
That is a query against that

426
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:27,735
graph that says,

427
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,675
give me
transitively everything

428
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,420
from which these things
are are derived.

429
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
This is just one
quick example that,

430
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,080
you know, I think
is is is a common

431
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,240
visual implementation in a in

432
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,155
a cataloging and and lineage

433
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,175
solution to show
you kind of how

434
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,595
you what you're
doing is really

435
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,035
querying across this graph

436
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:47,500
database and pulling
out an interesting

437
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,440
subgraph to address
a particular query.

438
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,720
With that, I'll hand
it back to Juan.

439
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,475
Great. So we the point here is

440
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,655
that your data
catalog is about

441
00:12:58,715 --> 00:12:59,675
managing and
understanding your

442
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:01,035
metadata. And if
you're gonna do that,

443
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,235
it ends up being a graph.

444
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:03,435
So it ends up
being a knowledge

445
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,580
graph itself. But
I know everybody

446
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,780
here is really excited about

447
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,260
knowledge graphs,

448
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,380
and we're trying to
learn about that.

449
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,660
And our position is that your

450
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,260
knowledge graph
should be powered

451
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,480
by a data catalog.

452
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:14,685
So let's think about it.

453
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,285
When within organizations,

454
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:18,765
you don't know what
data you have.

455
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,185
This is the common problem

456
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,545
everybody has. Right?

457
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,480
We We don't know what data we

458
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,360
need to go search for data,

459
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,720
so let's go catalog it.

460
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
Let's go literally crawl and

461
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,060
bring in all that
metadata together.

462
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,085
But when you do that,

463
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,365
you wanna be able to start

464
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:32,245
connecting it together to

465
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,605
understand how things
are connected,

466
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,385
everything that Brian
just mentioned.

467
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,240
Once you start
cataloging that data,

468
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,620
you wanna go find the data,

469
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,800
the next thing is, like,

470
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,660
I wanna go access that data.

471
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
I found the data
that I needed.

472
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,115
Right? Regard I
talked to somebody.

473
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:47,815
I figured out how
things were connected.

474
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:50,055
I now wanna go
access that data.

475
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,955
Let it be give me access to

476
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,395
the raw data
because it's being

477
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:54,890
sent to me, or I wanna be able

478
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,190
to go query that data.

479
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,850
And at this point is when you

480
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,010
start realizing
that I I I I can

481
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,270
go query it using
data virtualization

482
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:05,145
technology, data
federation technology.

483
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,745
I wanna take a table in one

484
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,945
database and
the table in another

485
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:09,805
database and go join
them together.

486
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
Right? We wanna be
able to provide

487
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
users with that quick and easy

488
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,500
access to the data.

489
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,080
But this continues to be what

490
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,965
we call
the application centric

491
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,505
view of the data. Right?

492
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,245
When when we talk about real

493
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,765
world enterprise
databases that

494
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:25,505
you're cataloging,

495
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,085
you're cataloging
databases that

496
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,920
have hundreds, if
not thousands,

497
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,900
of tables and thousands,

498
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,680
if not ten thousand columns.

499
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,985
And at this point,
you want I mean,

500
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:37,265
our position is that you want

501
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:38,545
people to realize that their

502
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,605
data is a mess,

503
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,585
and you want them to kind of

504
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:43,265
crash into the wall
and realize,

505
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:44,770
wait. My data I don't

506
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,390
cataloging also the usage
of the people,

507
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:54,855
and you start
realizing what are

508
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:57,115
the different the most
important data,

509
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:58,955
assets that people
are querying.

510
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:00,750
You can start cataloging also

511
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,030
the queries that
people are doing,

512
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,330
and you realize, wow.

513
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,790
People are querying for orders

514
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,650
in all these three,
four different ways.

515
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,205
And when you start
talking to people,

516
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,585
you realize, wow.

517
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:11,925
You use the word order,

518
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:13,605
and it means three different

519
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:14,905
things to different people.

520
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,110
So you start realizing these

521
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,790
things once you
start cataloging

522
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,830
the data. And then when you

523
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,190
start cataloging the data and

524
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,730
accessing the data as it is,

525
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:23,855
people realize,

526
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,775
I don't understand my data.

527
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:28,575
And at that point is
when they realize,

528
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,390
I need to add my knowledge on

529
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,610
top of that data.

530
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,150
I don't want to go write these

531
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,930
really complicated application

532
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,065
centric view
queries to get what

533
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,665
is in order. I would like to

534
00:15:40,665 --> 00:15:42,665
just have a concept
called order

535
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,345
and just access
the data through

536
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:46,445
that concept and get it.

537
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,900
But if we I think a tendency

538
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,020
that we see a lot is people

539
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
wanna jump into this knowledge

540
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,320
aspect first.

541
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,200
We call this to crawl,
walk, and run.

542
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,395
You wanna be able
to first crawl,

543
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:00,555
catalog your data, walk,

544
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,155
go access the data,

545
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,235
understand how that
data is today,

546
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
and realize that
there there are

547
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,080
a lot of pains, and
I understand it.

548
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,180
And when you start
cataloging the usage,

549
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
you start realizing which are

550
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,665
the aspects most
important to people.

551
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,105
And at that stage,

552
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,705
you start you can go go into

553
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:17,425
the running phase,

554
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,785
which is let's go create add

555
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,065
the knowledge to
it and go create

556
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:21,125
that knowledge graph.

557
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:22,865
And by doing this
crawl, walk,

558
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:23,605
and run,

559
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,020
it helps us focus
on what people

560
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,960
are actually using
and needing,

561
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,520
and that avoids
boiling the ocean.

562
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:31,595
Because this is something that

563
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,835
we have seen over
and over again,

564
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,275
that people want
to jump in and

565
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,075
create their knowledge graph,

566
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,275
and they start
building this big

567
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,295
knowledge graph
with having a clear

568
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:40,415
view of success.

569
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,170
So the crawl and walk is what

570
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,030
we call the the data catalog,

571
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,770
and the knowledge graph aspect

572
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,370
is when you're
starting to go run,

573
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,330
create that knowledge graph,

574
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,515
and then actually using that

575
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,415
knowledge graph.

576
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,755
That's why we say
the knowledge

577
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,115
graph should be
powered by your

578
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:55,895
data catalog in order
to be successful.

579
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,260
So to get a little bit more of

580
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,380
an example, when
you're starting

581
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,400
to go catalog,
this is an example

582
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,720
of a real world
enterprise database.

583
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,595
Right? This is something that

584
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:06,955
you can go catalog
and understand

585
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,895
how things are
what things exist

586
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,155
in the real world. Right?

587
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,915
This is in your real world

588
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:12,895
enterprise databases.

589
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,080
But this is what
you if you give

590
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,480
this to your data
consumers, right,

591
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,440
your data scientists,

592
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,380
your data analysts,
your BI developers,

593
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:21,935
They're gonna
scratch their head

594
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,475
because they don't
understand this,

595
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,695
and that's why you go back and

596
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,775
forth with your data data

597
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:29,040
producers to understand it.

598
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,860
So you wanna be
able to go create

599
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,080
your knowledge graph as adding

600
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
that layer of of knowledge,

601
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,420
the layer of semantics.

602
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:40,275
So imagine viewing
the data this way.

603
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:42,415
You see the main the the real

604
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:44,755
world business
concepts, orders,

605
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,830
customers, billing
address, order lines.

606
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,510
Right? A per
customer purchases

607
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,730
an order and so forth.

608
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,470
You wanna be able to go access

609
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,865
this data. Access
the data in terms of,

610
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,965
in terms of this
knowledge graph view.

611
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,025
But when you're creating that

612
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:01,000
first catalog, you're starting

613
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,880
to come up, for example,

614
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,160
with the business
glossary terms,

615
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,440
and that helps you bootstrap

616
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,060
what this is going
to look like.

617
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,925
Now the big differentiation

618
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,145
between having this kind of,

619
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,145
the the the the knowledge graph

620
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,425
view versus what
I what we call

621
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,020
the application
centric view is,

622
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,660
if I have this
particular question.

623
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,100
Right? What are the orders and

624
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,780
their net sales
in a given time

625
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,080
period per their status?

626
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,125
To answer that question,

627
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,725
I would have to write one SQL

628
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:28,025
query over that database,

629
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:31,065
and it would be
a very complicated

630
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,020
SQL query. Something
that's much

631
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,640
harder to to to maintain,

632
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,980
something that a small amount

633
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,260
of people can be
able to understand

634
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,140
because they need to know

635
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,560
understand the application
database.

636
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,275
But when you're
starting to talk

637
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:43,875
about what I what we
call the knowledge

638
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,495
and data centric view of it,

639
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,115
your queries I'll
be I understand

640
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,320
they're in graph and sparkle

641
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
that may be a new thing,

642
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,400
but just think about that.

643
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,080
The queries are
now in terms of

644
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,120
the knowledge view.

645
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,045
This it's a data
centric view of this.

646
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,365
And this everything now starts

647
00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,585
to have a complete lineage.

648
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,725
So you if you're
asking what is

649
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,420
an order, I have
the connection

650
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,100
of what that concept order is

651
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,520
all the way back
to the original

652
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,640
application database.

653
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,940
That's why you
wanna be able to

654
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,535
start with
the metadata first.

655
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:17,015
So another aspect
that I really

656
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,775
want to push here
is that we all

657
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,795
think it's just
a technology problem.

658
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,750
It's not just
a technology problem.

659
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,350
It's a that's a fallacy.

660
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,250
It's about culture too,

661
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,450
and I think this is the other

662
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,310
aspect that we want
you to take away.

663
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,645
First of all, we
talk about tools,

664
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:33,945
but what about the people?

665
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:37,045
Ask yourself,
what does success

666
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,140
look like? How do you know if

667
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,420
you're going to
build a knowledge

668
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,960
graph you're being
successful?

669
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,160
Who is responsible
for the data?

670
00:19:45,905 --> 00:19:48,305
Assume that, you generate data

671
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:49,825
and and the data is being used

672
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,345
for to run some
machine learning

673
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:52,885
models to go make a decision,

674
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,465
and that and the decision that

675
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:56,180
was made was a failure.

676
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,040
It it sales went down.

677
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,800
Who's responsible for that?

678
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,560
On the contrary,

679
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,320
what if sales just increased

680
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,335
dramatically
because of the data

681
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:06,235
that was generated?

682
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:07,815
Who's responsible
gets promoted

683
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,275
for that? And, additionally,

684
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:12,075
who does the actual
knowledge work?

685
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,430
Who understands what these

686
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,510
concepts are and
understands how

687
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,030
they're supposed to what all

688
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,990
the different meanings and how

689
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,370
they're supposed
to be connected

690
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,810
to those physical databases?

691
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:25,095
I think this is this
is this is again,

692
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:26,375
this is not a problem solved

693
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,275
just by technology.

694
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:29,015
This is understanding
the people

695
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:29,915
who are involved,

696
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,950
understanding who is actually

697
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,730
going to be
consuming this data

698
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,590
and asking them what
success looks like.

699
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,630
Therefore, we need to be able

700
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,230
to understand what
are the business

701
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,855
needs, the business problems,

702
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,515
and tie everything that we're

703
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,675
doing with the data
to business value.

704
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:46,355
Otherwise, we're just having

705
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:48,115
we're we're we're
defining success

706
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,240
from a technical
point of view.

707
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,680
And I think this
is one of the key

708
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,760
problems. We have
been in the same

709
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,520
kind of rut in in enterprise

710
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,120
data management
because we define

711
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,400
success from a technical point

712
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,125
of view and not from a social

713
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,245
business point of view.

714
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:01,845
Bringing the data
into one place,

715
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,585
into one lake does not
solve my problem.

716
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,980
It solve the problem
is if the business

717
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,500
users are able to go answer

718
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,160
their questions.

719
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,640
That's how we need to
go define success.

720
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,960
Who is responsible
for the data?

721
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,865
We we treat software
with the respect

722
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:20,445
it deserves. It has a team.

723
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:22,000
It has a manager,

724
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,700
a product manager
that communicates

725
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,160
with the with
the with the users

726
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,600
of the software to
get the requirements

727
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,060
and translates
those requirements

728
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,815
to the engineers
and defines tests.

729
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:33,835
And we don't do
that for data.

730
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:35,735
We need to have this notion of

731
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,195
a data product manager,

732
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:38,615
and they're the ones who are

733
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,300
managing the this the datasets

734
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,520
that are coming out of that.

735
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,520
And who does this
knowledge work?

736
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,560
We all confuse we're
all confused,

737
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:48,665
and then we say that the data

738
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:49,305
scientists, right,

739
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:50,585
are the ones who's
supposed to do it,

740
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:51,785
and they complain
of the eighty

741
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:52,425
twenty rule. Right?

742
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,625
Eighty percent of the data

743
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,250
scientists spend their time

744
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,130
cleaning the data,

745
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,570
and then only
twenty percent of

746
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,090
the time they do
the analysis.

747
00:21:59,090 --> 00:21:59,910
And that's true.

748
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,570
But now we treat this eighty

749
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,445
percent almost
with disrespect.

750
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:05,365
We say it's a data janitorial

751
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,285
work when it's the crucial

752
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:08,565
knowledge work,

753
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,945
that knowledge of what things

754
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:11,925
mean in our company.

755
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,390
So this needs to be kind of we

756
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,670
need to separate
it and make it

757
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,350
into its own diff own,

758
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,790
role and what we're calling

759
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,850
the knowledge scientist.

760
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:22,425
Now people work together,

761
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,225
and the question is,

762
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,265
how do they work together?

763
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:25,705
What are the processes that

764
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,005
people need to go to?

765
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,065
How do you avoid avoid boiling

766
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,650
the ocean? We don't wanna have

767
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,350
the old school
waterfall approach.

768
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,090
Yeah. How do people
work together?

769
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,430
Right? We need to have agile

770
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:37,845
agile methodologies,

771
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,665
what we're calling agile data

772
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:41,185
governance. And
one of the things

773
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:42,545
I always tell
people is, like,

774
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:44,630
why do we have
brakes in a car?

775
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,230
And the immediate
response usually

776
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,830
is is so we can go slow.

777
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,130
It's like, but no.

778
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,870
We have brakes in a car so we

779
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,745
can drive fast safely.

780
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,245
And that's the mentality that

781
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,285
we need to go think about when

782
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:56,505
we're thinking about data.

783
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,165
And how do people
work together?

784
00:22:58,165 --> 00:22:59,605
The data product manager needs

785
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:00,665
to set up sprints.

786
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,150
We need to think about how to

787
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,130
document data.

788
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,650
We would never
dare release code

789
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,710
into a master
branch without any

790
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,495
comments. Why do we
do that for data?

791
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,635
We don't we don't
document it.

792
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,155
We don't document
how it's being

793
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:16,775
transformed,
the transformations,

794
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,775
the queries. We
don't do that.

795
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
We would never dare right now

796
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,720
to go release code
without anybody,

797
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,180
code reviewing it. Right?

798
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,140
We do pull requests.

799
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,915
People go review
our codes. Right?

800
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:30,615
We we even do peer
programming.

801
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:32,455
Why don't we do
that for data?

802
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:34,275
These are the these
are the social

803
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:35,895
aspects that we need
to go consider.

804
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,900
So to take away, frankly,

805
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,920
I think it's just time to

806
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,620
transform enterprise
data integration.

807
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,300
The way we have
been integrating

808
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,925
data has been the same.

809
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:49,425
So your data
catalog powered by

810
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,385
a knowledge graph.

811
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,730
Your first knowledge
graph should

812
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,950
be of your metadata,

813
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,390
of your tables and
columns. Why?

814
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,650
Because you need to know what

815
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,715
data you have.
And by know means

816
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:01,855
you need to have a knowledge.

817
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,535
That's what we're
talking about.

818
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:04,875
The knowledge graph of your

819
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:05,995
first knowledge
graph should be

820
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:07,535
should be of your
of your metadata.

821
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,030
And then your knowledge graph

822
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,570
should be powered by
the data catalog.

823
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,790
To build your
enterprise knowledge

824
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,950
graph, it needs to be done to

825
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,515
solve business pain points.

826
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:19,755
And I know people are gonna be

827
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:21,215
so tempted to run,

828
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:23,515
to jump and start
creating their

829
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:26,255
knowledge graph.
Please don't do that.

830
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,510
Why not? Because
you are basically

831
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,930
diving into the deep end,

832
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,870
and you will most
probably drown,

833
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,870
meaning you're
probably gonna fail.

834
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:36,815
And what's gonna
happen is that

835
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,475
when people start looking at

836
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:39,995
this knowledge graph,
they're gonna ask,

837
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,435
where does this
data come from?

838
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:42,975
How do I know I can trust it?

839
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:44,495
And the answer to that,

840
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,080
it's the metadata.

841
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,420
So that's why you should start

842
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,660
with the data
catalog as a strong

843
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,040
foundation of metadata.

844
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,945
Crawl and walk first in order

845
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:57,385
to succeed with your knowledge

846
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:58,765
graph to run.

847
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,905
And I know Brian
has some final

848
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:02,860
words here. No. I think yep.

849
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,620
Just just just as you said,

850
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,860
your data catalog is
a knowledge graph.

851
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,560
That knowledge
graph is actually

852
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,060
going to be a fundamental and

853
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,195
critical part of
your enterprise

854
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:14,015
knowledge graph of
your enterprise

855
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:14,835
knowledge graph.

856
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,655
The the knowledge in your

857
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:17,855
knowledge graph
isn't knowledge

858
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,295
if you can't kind
of state where

859
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:20,355
it comes from.

860
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,250
And that is exactly
what having

861
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,770
a model of your of of
your data assets,

862
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,410
the metadata about
your your your data,

863
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,135
your policies,
your organization,

864
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:32,355
and how it all
hangs together.

865
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:34,575
It is it is it is
the foundation

866
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,375
of your knowledge graph,

867
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,975
and it is fundamentally a part

868
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:39,130
of an integral part of having

869
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,290
a a real and
powerful knowledge

870
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,350
graph for your enterprise.

871
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,130
And and one final point is we

872
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,355
have to be very honest.

873
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:47,955
We're people who are here who

874
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,395
are attending this
the this this

875
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,155
conference, we're
all very excited,

876
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,075
but we even though
we see Gartner

877
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,195
and we see where
they're putting

878
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:55,680
knowledge graphs and
all that stuff,

879
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,700
this is frankly
still very early.

880
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,780
Right? People are
not companies

881
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,280
are not knocking on their door

882
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,120
on on and say, I want
a knowledge graph.

883
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,820
They do not have
a budget item,

884
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,405
the budget line item that says

885
00:26:06,405 --> 00:26:07,445
go buy a knowledge graph.

886
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:08,665
They're not there yet.

887
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,005
So knowledge graph
is still new

888
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:10,725
in the industry.

889
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:13,065
There needs a lot of
education for it.

890
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,400
So we believe
that a way to get

891
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,760
knowledge graph
in is just focus

892
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
on a data catalog
powered by a knowledge

893
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,520
graph to sneak
in the knowledge

894
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,820
graph within an organization.

895
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:24,035
The value of a data catalog is

896
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:25,495
evident right now
to the business.

897
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:27,075
Right? There's magic quadrants

898
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:28,435
for data catalogs. Right?

899
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:29,795
There is a line item to go buy

900
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:30,695
a data catalog.

901
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,810
The market is
asking for a data

902
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,490
catalog now. So if you wanna

903
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,510
help the knowledge
graph industry grow,

904
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,090
start with the data catalog

905
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,390
powered by a knowledge graph.

906
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:42,455
And with that, thank
you very much.

907
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,290
I think, George,

908
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,830
you're you're on to
moderate questions?

909
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,490
Yep. Yeah. Yeah.

910
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,675
And, actually,
you've been quite

911
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:57,515
active in responding while,

912
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:58,715
you were giving the talk,

913
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:00,555
which is pretty unusual,

914
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,235
but also a little
bit unfair if

915
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:03,835
I compare to the other people

916
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:04,875
who gave talks because there's

917
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,940
two of you. So well done.

918
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,300
And, CEO also started
the conversation

919
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
with, Dean Alemanc
in the comments,

920
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,560
which I've been following with

921
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,620
with great interest.

922
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:15,675
And so I'll just relay,

923
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,475
the insulators
comment, basically.

924
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:20,615
So he's saying for
the benefit of,

925
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:22,375
the rest of the people
who may not,

926
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,075
have the chance to,

927
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,130
to to follow
the conversation.

928
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,110
So he's asking,

929
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,770
how do Juan's comments about

930
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,610
data governance
relate to the fact

931
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,130
that we'd like to reuse data

932
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,670
from outside organization?

933
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:35,485
We don't know if the external

934
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:37,005
data has undergone
the governance

935
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,065
that he talks about.

936
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,965
Does that mean that
we can't use it?

937
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,610
And he he hopes not.

938
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,030
And it's it's a long comment,

939
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,930
and it it includes a number of

940
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,750
questions, actually.

941
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,125
And then it he concludes by

942
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,885
asking how do we
reconcile the need

943
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:53,485
to manage data in the way Juan

944
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,085
is talking about
with the desire

945
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:57,850
to use external data. Yeah.

946
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,150
I mean, you know, I
can jump in on that.

947
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,270
That's what I I
think it's a it's

948
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:01,910
a great question.

949
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,430
And, you know, I
think, you know,

950
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,765
the answer is you can you can

951
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,265
represent that
external data as

952
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,025
as concepts and entities.

953
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:14,160
You can represent
what governance

954
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,980
has taken place if you know

955
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,220
about it externally and what

956
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,500
governance may
have taken place

957
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,380
on that internally. Right?

958
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,840
You know, the so, folks,

959
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:23,005
something we could
ask a lot is,

960
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,005
like, how do we deal
with data quality?

961
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:25,965
How do you kind of know that

962
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,565
only data only quality data is

963
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:28,945
within the within
the catalog?

964
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:31,745
And the answer is,
well, we we don't,

965
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,960
but we do in
the sense that data

966
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
quality isn't
an absolute isn't

967
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
an absolute thing. Right?

968
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,440
It's always kind
of use case and

969
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,135
need dependent.

970
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,575
So what you can do is you can

971
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:43,175
represent facts about data.

972
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:45,495
What what what
assessments have

973
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:46,555
been made? What ascertainments

974
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,140
have been made
about this data?

975
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,140
And then within
a particular context,

976
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
you can assess you
can assert policies,

977
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,600
which are what ascertainments

978
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,780
need to have been made about

979
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,060
this data in order
for it to be

980
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,495
useful for this
this use case.

981
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:59,835
And so the same piece of data

982
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:02,135
might be completely usable for

983
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:03,335
some kinds of research courses

984
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:04,635
purposes within
your organization.

985
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:06,455
It might be totally
unusable if

986
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:07,640
you're putting
together, you know,

987
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,720
your s a c SEC filings because

988
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
it hasn't gone through proper

989
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,880
proper vetting.

990
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,480
That's not two different
pieces of data.

991
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,600
It's it's not two different it

992
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,740
it is two
different ascertainments

993
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,225
of quality for
different purposes.

994
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,025
And and, you know,

995
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:20,605
third party data
is is absolutely,

996
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,745
you know, part of part
of your catalog.

997
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,045
You just need to understand

998
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:25,645
where did this data come from

999
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:28,510
and what what
governance has has

1000
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,410
been been you know,
I would say,

1001
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,450
though, like, if you know,

1002
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,090
to to kind of, like,

1003
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,720
back to the framing
of the question,

1004
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:35,105
if you just bring in a catalog

1005
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,305
of here's a bunch of open data

1006
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:37,185
that we haven't really looked

1007
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,265
at or or or
scrutinized or made

1008
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:40,465
any ascertainments about,

1009
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,745
you probably
shouldn't use that

1010
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:43,265
for most for for most critical

1011
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,450
use cases because you actually

1012
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,810
don't you don't actually know

1013
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,330
anything about
about the quality.

1014
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,530
So you have to
really kinda have

1015
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,530
a what factual quality as

1016
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,055
ascertained to
the name and how

1017
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:53,095
does that and how does that

1018
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,695
relate to the policies of use

1019
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,535
that I have? So so a couple of

1020
00:29:56,535 --> 00:29:57,255
things I wanna add.

1021
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:58,775
One is you first need to go

1022
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:00,375
catalog your own stuff to go

1023
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,820
know what I have before you

1024
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,940
wanna go bring other things.

1025
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,980
Otherwise, you're just, like,

1026
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,940
throwing stuff in the wall and

1027
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,920
see what sticks.

1028
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,220
Second, this should
be use case driven.

1029
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,415
Right? Why why
are you going to

1030
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,375
bring in this other data?

1031
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,495
What is the problem
that you're

1032
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:14,035
gonna try to solve with that?

1033
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:15,775
So I think that's
how you wanna

1034
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:17,375
be able to go bring
understand that.

1035
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,700
And then once you realize that

1036
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,980
I have this
particular use case,

1037
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,360
this is the problem
I'm gonna go solve,

1038
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,380
you're gonna bring in that

1039
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,500
external data inside,

1040
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,940
and and then you're gonna have

1041
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,835
to add the governance
to it and

1042
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:27,555
figure out, well,

1043
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,915
can I actually
use this or not?

1044
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:29,875
Right? I don't I mean,

1045
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,475
we we're so kind of entrenched

1046
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:32,835
now with these magic wands of

1047
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:34,035
AI and stuff. It's like,

1048
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:35,495
you put people in the room,

1049
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,500
they won't even agree.

1050
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,940
Why the heck do
we believe that

1051
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,060
AI is gonna come
up with the right

1052
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,580
answer when the humans
won't even agree?

1053
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,860
We need to stop thinking about

1054
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,820
that for for for I mean,

1055
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,020
we need to kinda
really put our

1056
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,525
our feet on the ground
on that aspect.

1057
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,685
Now the I think the the way

1058
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:48,965
the market is going
to get involved,

1059
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:50,085
and this is much bigger than

1060
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:52,025
knowledge graphs, is
a data marketplace.

1061
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,380
A data marketplace is going to

1062
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,400
be a data catalog
of your internal

1063
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,840
and your external data.

1064
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,420
And you're gonna see and so

1065
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,940
you're you have data catalogs

1066
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,525
for for folks to go use it

1067
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:03,985
internally in their
in their enterprise,

1068
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:05,485
and we're gonna start seeing

1069
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:07,165
data catalogs of
open data that

1070
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,205
are really starting
to add that

1071
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:10,000
governance. And guess what?

1072
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,260
So I think the winners are be

1073
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,940
are the ones are
the data catalogs

1074
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,800
that are gonna be
able to do both.

1075
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,180
So take a look
and watch out for

1076
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,355
data dot world for sure.

1077
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:19,475
And I think I'm looking at one

1078
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:20,515
of the chats there,

1079
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,195
from Janine Hill
asking about,

1080
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:23,875
the somebody was asking about

1081
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,955
the ontology,
that that we that

1082
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:26,995
we were talking about.

1083
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:29,940
Frankly, the ontology we have

1084
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,220
is is is out there. Right?

1085
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,160
It's it's it's DCAD. It's DC.

1086
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,600
It's it's all that stuff.

1087
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,375
We internally have taken all

1088
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,815
that stuff and added
some glue together.

1089
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,095
Right? We need to go
connect that stuff.

1090
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:42,015
And I I think part
of our plan is to,

1091
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,055
we're cleaning it all up,

1092
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:44,255
and we just wanna
go release it.

1093
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:45,760
So we will be open
sourcing that

1094
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
the Datadog World
enterprise catalog.

1095
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,920
But note that it's all open

1096
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,840
standards plus a bunch of glue

1097
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,960
that we just added to that.

1098
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,135
So we're gonna I think that's

1099
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,415
something valuable
that the that

1100
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,475
the industry needs.
