1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello, and welcome
to this next

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,780
session of knowledge
connections.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,420
We're here with doctor
Maureen Tessier,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,580
who will be presenting on

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,240
unprecedented products in

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,105
commercial real estate with

7
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,625
automated generation of large

8
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,345
knowledge graphs.

9
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:19,305
And she'll tell
you a little bit

10
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:20,285
more about herself.

11
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:24,345
Oh, thank you so
much for having

12
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:25,405
me at this conference.

13
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,425
I am so happy to see
that the knowledge

14
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,920
graph community
has grown enough

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,360
that we can have an entire

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,060
conference focused on,

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,920
creating graph structures and

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,280
taking advantage of them.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,260
And and I'm I'm I'm
honored to be here.

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,420
And thank you all for,

21
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:45,635
joining my talk
on unprecedented

22
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:47,635
products and commercial
real estate.

23
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:51,615
I am currently
working as chief

24
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:54,015
data scientist at
Reonomy, which is a,

25
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,760
commercial real estate company

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,160
that builds property
intelligence,

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,540
and is located in
the United States.

28
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,320
Our headquarters
is in New York.

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,960
My background is,
in academia.

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,055
I well, worked,

31
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:15,695
in computational
astrophysics.

32
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:18,475
I generated and
analyzed hundreds

33
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,735
of terabytes of data
on cosmological

34
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,675
structures and
simulations of galaxies,

35
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:25,275
and you can see two images of

36
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,430
the simulations here.

37
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,870
I moved into the startup space

38
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,090
about six years ago.

39
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,090
And, one of the things that,

40
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,290
I was able to bring
from academia

41
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,445
and that I enjoy
in industry is

42
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:40,465
working in the,

43
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:45,265
where where engineering and ML

44
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,905
and AI meet. And,

45
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,385
building knowledge graphs,

46
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,820
provides me with
the opportunity

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,160
to do that in spades,

48
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,280
and that's one of the reasons

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,940
that I absolutely love
knowledge graphs.

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,080
So when you think
about commercial

51
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,685
real estate, this
is what people

52
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:04,485
typically think of.

53
00:02:04,485 --> 00:02:06,505
They they think about
office buildings.

54
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:07,865
They think about retail.

55
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,605
But the way that Reonomy has

56
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:10,885
defined commercial real estate

57
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,325
is that it's
anything that's not

58
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,625
a single family residence.

59
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,765
So there's a huge diversity in

60
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,705
the data that we
have to deal with,

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,240
to cover commercial
real estate

62
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,620
across the US. There's,

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,300
agricultural land.
There's transit hubs.

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,240
There are, huge malls.

65
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,380
There's gas stations.

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
There's vacant land.

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,420
There are apartment
complexes.

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,975
It's it's it's
any it's anything

69
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,415
and everything
that that you've

70
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:37,375
that you've seen this,

71
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,835
not a single
family residence.

72
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,475
For the US,

73
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:44,115
there are a hundred
and fifty million,

74
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,740
lots of land that have,

75
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,060
been designated as either

76
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,740
commercial or single
family residence.

77
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,340
And it's a little
under a hundred

78
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,120
million for single
family residences,

79
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,420
and it's a little over fifty

80
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,740
million for, commercial real

81
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,180
estate if you're
going to cover

82
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,160
all of the US.

83
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,155
So there's a large volume of

84
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:05,455
data as well as,

85
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,475
some some pretty diverse data

86
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,595
that you have to deal with on

87
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:11,375
the on the CRE side.

88
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,875
So one of the motivations for

89
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,815
using a knowledge
graph is that

90
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,810
is that there's many,

91
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,170
many different ways that human

92
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,790
beings interact with
these structures.

93
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,510
They have constructed
the structures.

94
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,010
They are modifying them.

95
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,150
They're fixing them.

96
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,070
People work within
the structures

97
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,050
that's in they do
industrial work.

98
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,285
They work as, shopkeepers.

99
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:36,565
They are, they
work in offices.

100
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:38,325
But people also,

101
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,705
work to maintain
the buildings.

102
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:41,845
They create
the infrastructure.

103
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,125
They set up the Ethernet.

104
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:46,000
They do the h v HVAC to make

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,820
sure that the insides
of the building

106
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
are filling the needs
of the people

107
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
who are present there during

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,300
the days or the evenings.

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,060
These but these
structures are are also,

110
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,485
used in a in a completely
different way.

111
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,425
They're used in
as data points,

112
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,085
to understand how
cities behave,

113
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,445
how neighborhoods
are changing,

114
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:07,885
and how the market
is changing.

115
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,705
So so tracking
the the behavior

116
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,285
of commercial real
estate, I mean,

117
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,520
it's a huge component
of the financial

118
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,160
behavior of of
the United States.

119
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,600
And then lastly,

120
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,440
people own these
structures as income.

121
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,680
So so they collect rent,

122
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,415
from the people who are using

123
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,195
the the structures
in different ways,

124
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,575
and they, you know,

125
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:34,935
after they pay off
their mortgages,

126
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:35,915
that's that's their,

127
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,315
primary source of
income in some cases.

128
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,735
So there's just
a lot of different

129
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:41,175
ways that people
are interacting

130
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:41,975
with these structures.

131
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,330
And already,

132
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,110
if you've been to
to other talks

133
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,750
in this conference,

134
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,870
you're probably
thinking about,

135
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,390
oh, look at all of
these different

136
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,970
edge types that,
should be created,

137
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,130
to to capture these
interactions.

138
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,435
Another motivation
that we have

139
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:58,715
for creating a Knowledge Graph

140
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,395
in this space is that we have

141
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,895
a lot of data,
but separately,

142
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,575
it's not actionable.

143
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:10,190
So in order to buy
choose to buy,

144
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,610
sell, or or rent a a space in

145
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,510
a in a structure,

146
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,150
you need to understand
the location,

147
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,730
the environment
of the building.

148
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,330
Is this an appropriate
place for

149
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,010
what you're trying to to do?

150
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,985
Is this a neighborhood that's

151
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:25,265
gentrifying and we're seeing

152
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:26,565
some economic growth?

153
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,945
What does
the financial history

154
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,945
of this of the building
look like?

155
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,165
What are the tax levels?

156
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,445
And then also,

157
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:35,985
who are the companies
and people

158
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:37,505
that I would reach out to if I

159
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,820
wanted to purchase
the property

160
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,740
or if I wanted to to manage

161
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,400
the property or if I
wanted to reroof,

162
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,360
the the structures
on the property,

163
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,140
in order to so so, yeah,

164
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,740
so there are lots
of pieces that

165
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,260
need to be put
together in order

166
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,885
for people to to do anything

167
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:55,845
with this data.

168
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:59,685
And, because the data is not

169
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,365
intended to be used in the way

170
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,225
that we we use it,

171
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:07,705
you this this is
a really good case for,

172
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,910
the reorganization
that you get

173
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,130
from a knowledge graph.

174
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,330
And the third and
last motivation

175
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,930
for knowledge graphs,

176
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,390
in in in the CRE space is that

177
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,390
there are hidden
truths in the CRE

178
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,095
space. So I've
made a little bit

179
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,435
of a graph cartoon
that illustrates

180
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:29,215
one example of of ownership of

181
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:30,835
properties within the US.

182
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,035
Property ownership
is completely

183
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,595
legally and
completely intentionally

184
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,700
hidden or obfuscated
in in many,

185
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,520
many cases.

186
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,260
So if you are a person that is

187
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,620
famous and you
don't want people

188
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,140
to know that you're
buying a property,

189
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,060
there are there
are legal vehicles

190
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,580
that you can use
to kind of hide

191
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,320
your ownership.

192
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,425
But what you see more commonly

193
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,585
is that corporations who are

194
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:57,185
trying to maintain
some kind of

195
00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:59,025
a competitive advantage when

196
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,225
they are buying or selling

197
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:04,660
properties will
create subsidiaries

198
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,860
or LLCs or DBAs
and buy properties

199
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,980
through, through through,

200
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
business structures that it's

201
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
not obvious where
these business

202
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,425
structures, connect
to the the the

203
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:21,705
the ultimate company that is

204
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:24,205
controlling, that
the behaviors.

205
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:26,685
And and,

206
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,705
what we've seen
from putting all

207
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,145
of these pieces together into

208
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:33,700
a graph is that is
that the ownership

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,140
structures can be,

210
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
six or eight hops deep.

211
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,740
So you can go across
six companies

212
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,300
or eight companies in
order to finally,

213
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
see who is who is actually

214
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,365
controlling and, who
owns these assets,

215
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:52,505
these commercial assets.

216
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,305
What does that mean
at a large scale?

217
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,185
What that means is
that at a high level,

218
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,425
we don't have
a good understanding

219
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,710
at all of who owns what across

220
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,030
the country. This is this is

221
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,110
something that just does not

222
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,590
it's it does not
exist in the world.

223
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,450
So the few
ownership portfolios

224
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,370
that that are around,

225
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,755
and there there are some and

226
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:17,975
there are very few.

227
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,775
They're expensive to create,

228
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:23,555
both in time and
in and in money

229
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,055
because they're done
by having humans,

230
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,810
research the properties and

231
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,570
research companies and and

232
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,750
manually put together
all of the pieces.

233
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,730
So so ownership is something

234
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,830
that is is highly valuable,

235
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,885
but is not something
that is is

236
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,485
not something that
that's present

237
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,965
and obvious in a way
that, you know,

238
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:51,005
in many European
countries, it it is.

239
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:52,385
I've been told it is.

240
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,530
So this is a third motivation

241
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,870
for us building our
Knowledge Graph.

242
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,550
So we have our motivation.

243
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,690
So what does building
the Knowledge

244
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,410
Graph look like?

245
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,670
And what do entity
based pipelines

246
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,265
look like?

247
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,305
So so the first thing that you

248
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:12,185
do is ingestion,

249
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,645
and you're probably getting,

250
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:15,965
flat tabular data sources.

251
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,005
They might be,

252
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,485
coming from
a relational database

253
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,305
database. They might be coming

254
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:22,045
from files.

255
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,360
And you're combining multiple

256
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,600
sources probably
together until

257
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,820
you create your graph.

258
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
In many cases, especially with

259
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,360
the data that we work with,

260
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,700
the data is incredibly messy.

261
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:38,555
There are missing values.

262
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:39,535
There are abbreviations.

263
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:40,815
There are misspellings.

264
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:43,115
There are just things that are

265
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,735
blatantly wrong.
There's misalignment.

266
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,195
So there there
are problems with

267
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,635
the data, and and that should

268
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:50,315
be kind of assumed
to be the the

269
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,010
the status quo.

270
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,610
If you're building
a robust pipeline,

271
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,470
you wanna build
against against

272
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,270
that expectation.

273
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,270
And then there's
also, context.

274
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,090
The data is context specific.

275
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,450
And and this kinda
goes back to

276
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,570
what I was saying before about

277
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,815
the data being disparate and

278
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,255
unconnected to other things.

279
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,695
And the reason that
it's unconnected

280
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:10,895
to other things
is because it's

281
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,515
built for one use case.

282
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,735
And we're trying to use it for

283
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,575
an entirely
different use case.

284
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,895
And so it's not
built for purpose.

285
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:20,655
It's built for built
for a different

286
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:25,070
purpose. The data
is mixed because

287
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,050
you have rows of
data where you

288
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,630
have information on multiple

289
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,990
different entity types.

290
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,130
So the the information about

291
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,145
the entities can
be mixed within

292
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,525
both columns and rows.

293
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,225
And then you
should expect that

294
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:43,825
you will get duplicates,
inter source,

295
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,985
so within the sources of data

296
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:46,885
that you're ingesting,

297
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,560
but also inter
source duplication,

298
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,760
if you are ingesting multiple

299
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,660
sources that kind
of cover the same

300
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,280
space. And that's
something that

301
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,980
you absolutely
would want to do

302
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,660
if you are looking to improve

303
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,625
the overall quality
of data that

304
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,225
you're putting
into your graph.

305
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:06,065
If you have we have multiple

306
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,365
data sources for companies.

307
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:08,945
We have multiple data sources

308
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:09,585
for properties,

309
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,265
and we have we do that very

310
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:13,605
intentionally.
And at duplicate

311
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:17,650
coverage, we can combine them

312
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,750
to to get
an overall improvement

313
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,110
in the in the data quality,

314
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,530
for for each area. Okay.

315
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,910
So the next step
is standardization

316
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,330
and cleaning. And
there are very

317
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,690
good reasons to put this very

318
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,435
early in the pipeline
when you're

319
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:32,195
doing when you're doing graph

320
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:33,815
construction. And primarily,

321
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,475
this is because
you're going to

322
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:37,235
be taking these
data sources and

323
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,335
shredding them
into two pieces.

324
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,315
And in some cases,

325
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,295
you'll be multithreading.

326
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,855
So so you might
have attributes

327
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,780
that could go to
multiple entities

328
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
depending on the definition of

329
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,060
your ontology and how you've,

330
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
how you've constructed it and

331
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,540
how dense your your graph is.

332
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:02,295
So doing the standardization,

333
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,275
doing the data cleaning very

334
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:07,075
early before you get
into the messiness

335
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:08,275
of the graph and you're trying

336
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:09,875
to use the values that you've

337
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,755
pulled from the data,

338
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:12,870
as well as
the context given to

339
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,650
you by the structure
of the data

340
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,870
in order to do
resolution is is

341
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,990
very important. Right?

342
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,790
If you don't do it,

343
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,470
you're handicapping your your

344
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,855
resolution efforts. Okay.

345
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:27,215
And next,

346
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:28,815
we get into this
green section.

347
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,095
This green section
is where you

348
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,735
see a difference in the two

349
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,175
pipeline options that I'm that

350
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,395
I'm presenting today.

351
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,380
So one option is that you you

352
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,640
take your stand
your your tabular,

353
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,420
flat, clean,
standardized data,

354
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,740
and you create
graph structures

355
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,180
immediately, and you throw it

356
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,140
into potentially,

357
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,580
you throw it into
a graph database

358
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,240
right away.

359
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,125
And there are there are

360
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,405
ramifications for doing this.

361
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:56,525
So I'm gonna talk about I'm

362
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,885
gonna go into
more detail about

363
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,085
both of both of
these different

364
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:00,545
cases and talk about
the ramifications

365
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:02,545
for throwing
something in early

366
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,305
and then performing resolution

367
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,225
or taking
an alternative approach

368
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,450
and doing resolution and edge

369
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,890
creation and and then throwing

370
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,670
the components into
a graph database.

371
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,530
They're they're a little bit

372
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,210
different faces of
the same coin,

373
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,225
but they actually have pretty

374
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:28,225
profound effects on the volume

375
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,825
of data that you
process and how

376
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,445
you process it and even some,

377
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,065
limitations. It sets some

378
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:35,985
limitations potentially
on the algorithms

379
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:38,405
that you want to do
to do resolution.

380
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,440
But at the end of
this green phase,

381
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,040
you will have
a knowledge graph

382
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,800
where where, you know,

383
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,340
you have resolved entities.

384
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,480
So you have each
entity is unique.

385
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,680
You have multiple different

386
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,200
entity types.
You have a ton of

387
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,260
different edge types.

388
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,195
And, potentially,

389
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:56,535
you have a beautiful knowledge

390
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,935
graph to use. But knowledge

391
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,155
graphs in and of themselves,

392
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,735
they're they're not
products. Right?

393
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,655
They're just it's
just a data store.

394
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:06,235
It's just a thrilling paradigm

395
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,870
shift in storing data.

396
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,150
So so there are
additional steps.

397
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,550
Right? One is extraction,

398
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,530
and creation of
of data packages

399
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,890
for products. So
this is you're

400
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,730
extracting information that is

401
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,805
a subset of
the information that

402
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,005
you contain within the graph,

403
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:26,865
and it's much more opinionated

404
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:28,225
and built for purpose.

405
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,805
And then the last piece is is

406
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,265
delivery of,

407
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:36,125
of the data that
you've extracted

408
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,325
for the graph, and you want to

409
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:39,870
be able to deliver
that in a performant

410
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,550
and and compatible way.

411
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,930
There are some specific cases

412
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,290
where you might be able to get

413
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,190
away with,

414
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,635
having a graph be your primary

415
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:53,715
data store and have your your

416
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,155
your potentially, like,

417
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,235
a UI layer or your API layer

418
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:58,995
directly interact
with the graph.

419
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,295
But in a lot of cases,

420
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:03,255
people are going to be asking

421
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:08,010
for traversal that
you are going

422
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,590
to cause, performance
problems because,

423
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,550
graph structures
notoriously have,

424
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,045
have there's they're they get

425
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,405
pretty slow pretty
quickly when

426
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:21,085
you're doing a lot
of traversal.

427
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,365
And so depending
on what you're

428
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,985
trying to build
into your product,

429
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,805
it's probably not a good idea

430
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:28,045
to have the graph
directly support

431
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,245
your product. You wanna have

432
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,605
intermediate layers
where you're

433
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:31,565
extracting the data,

434
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,940
and then you're
adding that data

435
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,140
into a different type of

436
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,580
infrastructure
in order to have

437
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,320
a really high
quality performant

438
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,400
product to deliver
to your clients.

439
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,140
Okay. So this seems pretty

440
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
complete and end to end,

441
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,805
but there's something that is

442
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:49,985
glaringly missing,

443
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,945
and that is and that
is your ontology.

444
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,185
And and the ontology,

445
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:56,525
as as you all know,

446
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,805
because I know
that that's been

447
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,005
addressed multiple times in

448
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,625
the in the conference is,

449
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,980
is is your is your
building plan.

450
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,800
Right? It's it's
like a building

451
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,680
plan for a house.

452
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,600
It defines all of the things

453
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
that you need.
These are all of

454
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,640
the entities that cover this

455
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,660
this domain space,
this industry.

456
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,660
These are all of
the edge types.

457
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:17,335
These are the things that we

458
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,095
would want for attributes as

459
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:20,955
opposed to entities,
etcetera.

460
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:25,975
So, your your ontology is I

461
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,035
advise actually,

462
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:31,320
defining the ontology
first and

463
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,080
using it to inform different

464
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
phases of the pipeline.

465
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,320
And and the reason that I've

466
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
introduced it
second is because

467
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,240
the context that you've gotten

468
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,740
from our our
short conversation

469
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,720
about the pipeline is is going

470
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,440
to show you how,

471
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,835
we use the ontology to inform

472
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:47,715
what we're doing at these

473
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,535
different phases.

474
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,555
So one of the things
that the ontology

475
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,255
is is great at is,

476
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,475
giving you confidence that you

477
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,635
have good coverage
from the data

478
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:00,230
that you're ingesting
across the space.

479
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,350
And this is this
is very important

480
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,970
because if you
are not covering

481
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,830
your entire ontology, then,

482
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,210
that there there's
a chance that

483
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:10,850
you're going to,

484
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,715
not just miss things
from your graph,

485
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,895
but also come up
with erroneous

486
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:17,075
conclusions. So
you're going to

487
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:17,955
get things wrong.

488
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,395
It depends a little bit on it

489
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:20,995
depends a lot on
the on the space

490
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:22,195
that you're using
and the products

491
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:22,835
that you're building,

492
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,295
but but that's the risk.

493
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,150
The ontology also helps with

494
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,970
the resolution in that if you

495
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,650
have a have a plan,

496
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,550
a a a structural
plan for the types

497
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,490
of entities that
you want to see

498
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,075
and the attributes
on those entities,

499
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,815
then you can make
sure that when

500
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:43,875
you're doing
the standardization

501
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:45,295
and you're doing
the cleaning,

502
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,495
that you're covering all of

503
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,015
those things in
order to set you

504
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,375
up for success
when you're doing

505
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:49,875
resolution.

506
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,780
The ontology also helps inform

507
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,140
the graph structures because

508
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,660
once you're at
the point in your

509
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,940
pipeline where you have this

510
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,320
beautiful knowledge graph,

511
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,280
you want to be
able to evaluate

512
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,145
it in order to
understand whether

513
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:08,805
you're you're really getting

514
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,045
things right. Are you under

515
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,085
resolving your entities?

516
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:13,605
Are you over resolving them?

517
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:15,685
Do you have is do
you have the right

518
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,285
volume of each entity type?

519
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:18,805
Do you have the right do you

520
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,085
have good coverage of all of

521
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:21,360
your different edge types?

522
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
And that's something that you

523
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,300
can you you can
reference the ontology

524
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
in order to give you a better

525
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,940
understanding of,

526
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
whether your graph is looks

527
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,140
the way that it needs to.

528
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,495
And then lastly,
the ontology is,

529
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:44,135
something that's very valuable

530
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:45,815
in supporting product.

531
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:47,155
And this is where it shows up

532
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,755
in the pipeline,
but but, again,

533
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,435
you want your
ontology early and

534
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,930
you want it to
inform the different

535
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,050
phases of the pipeline.

536
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,250
And this is one
of those phases

537
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,790
where you do want
to use the ontology

538
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,990
to work with,

539
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,230
both the to kind of
form a a a document

540
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,465
layer that pulls the product

541
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,385
people and
the technical people

542
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:09,325
together. And,

543
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,605
if you've done it
successfully,

544
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:15,545
then the extraction
and the packaging

545
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,100
of the data from your graph,

546
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,660
will work very,

547
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,760
very well for supporting
the product.

548
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,180
And if you haven't done that

549
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,860
successfully, then then you'll

550
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,160
have to make
some modifications

551
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,300
to your ontology
and and go back

552
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,580
and look at some of your edge

553
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,585
types and some of the entities

554
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:33,025
that you're doing
resolution on

555
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,545
and and and change
the way that

556
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:38,645
you're processing data. Okay.

557
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:41,265
So let's dig into these green

558
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,885
sections a little bit more.

559
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,470
So for for the for the top

560
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,410
situation where you are,

561
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,570
exploding your
data and you are,

562
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,130
throwing things into,

563
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,350
graph structures and a graph

564
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,665
database potentially, early,

565
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:03,225
you will be,

566
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,225
treating the data
in a a maximalistic

567
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:09,385
way. And what I mean
by maximalistic

568
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:14,090
is that you are exploding your

569
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,330
your data. You're
taking if you

570
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:18,170
have a tabular
data set and you

571
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,090
take the rows
within that tabular

572
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,030
data set and you
use the implicit

573
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,010
information that
they're all all

574
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,290
of these things
are on the same

575
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,285
row and you explode
those into edges,

576
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,145
you are increasing the volume

577
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,765
of the data that you have to

578
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:32,745
compute over.

579
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,745
So you're doing
and, potentially,

580
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,745
you're doing maximal
edge creation

581
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,485
where maybe you don't have any

582
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:43,010
attributes on
your entities and

583
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,370
everything you're treating

584
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,410
everything as an entity,

585
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,030
and so every cell within,

586
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,650
the tables that
you're probably

587
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,430
ingesting, will be
will be exploded.

588
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,555
So so you potentially,

589
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,555
you're exploding
your data a a great

590
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:58,835
deal depending on how you've

591
00:20:58,835 --> 00:20:59,815
defined your ontology.

592
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,675
You inter source
edge creation,

593
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:07,015
there that that's
something that

594
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,630
also is typically done first

595
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,610
when you are,

596
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,110
exploding exploding
the data and

597
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,470
creating the graph components

598
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,990
and putting them
into the graph

599
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,610
before you try to
do resolution.

600
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,705
And, there are simple
ways to do that.

601
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,625
Right? It it's
people have been

602
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,825
doing that using rules and

603
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,745
similarity metrics
for for quite

604
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,945
some time now. There are more

605
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:30,085
sophisticated ways.

606
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:31,745
The example that
I have on this

607
00:21:31,745 --> 00:21:33,665
slide where we have Jenny and

608
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,040
she has the number eight six

609
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
seven five three zero nine is

610
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
probably the most simple case

611
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,700
that that you can look at.

612
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,840
So there's there's
a phone number.

613
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
It's formatted in
the same way.

614
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,800
It's the same phone number.

615
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,080
The name is the same.

616
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,020
There's some
attribute information

617
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,800
that's different,

618
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,325
but there's high
enough confidence

619
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:54,225
that we can collapse the edges

620
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,225
and the entities
into something

621
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,585
that looks like a structure

622
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,205
that's at the bottom
of the slide.

623
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,845
And that's why I also cause

624
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,140
the this option
for constructing

625
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,980
your pipeline
destructive because

626
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,520
you're doing entity resolution

627
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,580
through destroying edges and

628
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,700
destroying vertices. Right?

629
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,200
So your resolution is
edge contraction.

630
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:17,635
There are lots of models that

631
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:21,155
you can use, for
for to do this.

632
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,775
Right? There's hyper
node creation.

633
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:23,955
There's path finding.

634
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:26,135
There's clustering.
There's graph CNNs.

635
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,295
There's deep walks,
and there have been,

636
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,810
several talks and
I think a few

637
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,650
more to come on
a lot of these,

638
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,730
techniques. The the thing that

639
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,370
I that I wanna
emphasize here,

640
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,490
because it's something to be

641
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,365
aware of before you
create the situation

642
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:44,565
for yourself is that you are

643
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:45,605
looking at something that's

644
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,685
potentially traversal
heavy. Right?

645
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,065
So depending on the complexity

646
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:50,725
of the entity that
you're trying

647
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:52,405
to resolve on, you might not

648
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,405
have all of the attributes on

649
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,105
the entity. You
might not have,

650
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,730
you know, all of the,

651
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,190
the neighboring entities that

652
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,890
you're going to
use to collapse

653
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,270
your your the entity
that you're

654
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,330
focused on resolving.

655
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,590
You might not have those next

656
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,150
to each of these.

657
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,510
So you might end
up in a situation

658
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,470
where you're doing a lot of

659
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,990
traversal across the graph.

660
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,215
And, even if you're
doing extraction,

661
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,715
you you still have to do that

662
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:16,435
traversal step.

663
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:17,795
So you're creating a situation

664
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:18,935
for yourself where,

665
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:22,135
you're increasing
the the computational

666
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,155
time that the this
step in your

667
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,615
pipeline will take to run.

668
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,500
The other option,

669
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,380
I call minimalistic
and constructive.

670
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
And the reason that I call it

671
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,680
minimalistic is
that it it aims

672
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,760
to keep the data as compressed

673
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,680
as possible before
it's delivered

674
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,995
to the app. And
you you're only

675
00:23:43,995 --> 00:23:46,555
creating the entities that you

676
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,575
know that you are
going to need.

677
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,515
So you do entity
creation first.

678
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,235
You have a model
per entity, type.

679
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:55,915
You could also
have a model per

680
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:58,050
edge type, but
you might not you

681
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,650
don't necessarily need that if

682
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,950
the edges are explicit
or implicit,

683
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,790
within your data sources.

684
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,450
And so the way
that you go about

685
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,625
the the entity
create the entity

686
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,985
creation in this case, right,

687
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,445
is that you have two datasets

688
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:15,265
and you maybe you have person

689
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:17,265
information in dataset one and

690
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,805
person information in dataset

691
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:20,065
in dataset two,

692
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:22,545
and you want to
see if the person

693
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,145
information in
these rows actually

694
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:25,605
belongs to the same entities.

695
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,080
So you group the information

696
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,360
from these records together

697
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,560
using adaptive blocking,

698
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,660
which is just
a fast high recall

699
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,120
step in order to find the most

700
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,780
likely candidates
for resolution.

701
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:39,765
And then you run your high

702
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:40,645
accuracy model,

703
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,325
which could be a machine
learning model,

704
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:43,125
it could be AI,

705
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,985
or it could be
a probabilistic model.

706
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,765
And, if you're
constructing a knowledge

707
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:48,885
graph, you might
have you might

708
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:49,765
have all of the above.

709
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:50,805
You might have used every

710
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:53,470
technique that
that you've seen

711
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,990
on the on the slide so far,

712
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,070
depending on depending on what

713
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,430
your data looks like. Right?

714
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,050
So you so you
should be tailoring

715
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,310
the technique. It should be

716
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,870
based on what's required by

717
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,470
the by the data,
by the values,

718
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,245
and and potentially
by the graph

719
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,505
structures.
Adaptive the cons,

720
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:15,325
for for using the this this

721
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:17,085
approach is is that adaptive

722
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,365
blocking in particular creates

723
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,125
a lot of skew in
in the pipeline,

724
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,985
which can slow your
pipelines down.

725
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,310
And then because you're being

726
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,510
minimalistic, there could be

727
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,290
things that you
did not anticipate

728
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,790
or understand about the data,

729
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,550
and and so you
could be missing

730
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,330
graph components
because of that.

731
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:35,945
Right. And then the edges in

732
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:37,465
this case are are
created after

733
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:38,585
the entities, and they're

734
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:40,825
explicitly defined
potentially,

735
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:42,125
they're explicitly
or implicitly

736
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:44,605
defined in the source
data, right,

737
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:47,700
through, through,

738
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,020
primary and secondary keys or

739
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,220
just by the presence of things

740
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,280
on the same row.

741
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,820
And you can use the adaptive

742
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,260
the same adaptive blocking

743
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,940
techniques with ML, AI,

744
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,240
probabilistic models.

745
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,820
And our and
the question is just

746
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,780
different. It's not,

747
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,235
are these things
this are these

748
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:05,195
pieces of information,

749
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:06,395
do they belong to
the same thing?

750
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:07,115
It's not that.

751
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,995
It's the is this
thing connected

752
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:10,895
to this thing?

753
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:17,220
Okay. So this is just a little

754
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,900
bit of an overview about some

755
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,940
of the things that I've talked

756
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,800
about for two
different approaches,

757
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,220
two different
pipeline approaches,

758
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,800
and how that has
ramifications on,

759
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,980
some of the model choices that

760
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,800
you might make.

761
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,475
And, oh,

762
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:33,675
and I forgot to talk about

763
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,275
flexibility and
attribute choice.

764
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:38,475
For so so for for
the for the first

765
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:41,455
case, you probably want to

766
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,160
skew towards
creating more more

767
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,940
entities. Right?

768
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
Whereas in the second case,

769
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,160
you might want to skew towards

770
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,080
creating less
entities in order

771
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,680
to keep the graph more compact

772
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,440
and the the volume
of data going

773
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,725
through your
pipeline, smaller.

774
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,545
And an example of where you

775
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,065
would do this is like
a phone number.

776
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,745
So is a is a phone
number really

777
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:10,205
valuable to the product
as an entity,

778
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:13,865
or is it right?

779
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,120
And is it valuable
to the model?

780
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,280
Is it needed by the technique

781
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,820
that you're using to
do the resolution?

782
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,140
Or is it really valuable
as an attribute

783
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,140
that you use to
create a connection?

784
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,535
And the edge that's important

785
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,295
is how the person
is related to

786
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:31,975
a company, not
that a person is

787
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:33,255
related to a phone number and

788
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:35,035
a phone number is
related to a company.

789
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:36,535
So it's important to really

790
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:37,895
think about your
edge types and

791
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:39,355
what's needed for
the product,

792
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:44,050
as I mentioned before. Okay.

793
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,530
So at Reonomy, we've thought

794
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,870
about all of these
things, and we have,

795
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,110
pretty extensive,
to say the least,

796
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,270
pipelines with
a lot of models.

797
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,495
And so what what
we've ended up

798
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,115
with at this point,

799
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:04,255
and and work is
still ongoing,

800
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:05,715
is we have over
fifty million,

801
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:07,875
resolved property entities.

802
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:09,775
We have over a hundred million

803
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:11,075
resolved company entities.

804
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,080
We have over sixty
five million

805
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,820
resolved people
that are related

806
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,880
to the companies
and the properties

807
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,780
within the Reonomy Graph.

808
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,140
So any people that
aren't involved

809
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,580
in the commercial
real estate space,

810
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,960
we don't care about them.

811
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,000
They're not included.

812
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:29,535
And then and then
we have, over,

813
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,395
thirty billion
entity attributes,

814
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:34,335
hanging off of these entities

815
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:35,155
in our graph.

816
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:38,495
So so it's it's
it's quite a bit

817
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:39,875
of information, and,

818
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,230
we found it to be
very powerful.

819
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,690
So, one of the ways that it's

820
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,210
displayed in our
product is this

821
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,890
property centric
view where for

822
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,830
each property node,
we have a page,

823
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,510
about that property.

824
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,805
So it has some attributes like

825
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,665
the address, structural
information.

826
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,785
There's a model
that runs that,

827
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:03,165
defines whether
the property is

828
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:05,345
likely to sell in
the next several

829
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:08,065
months. You have transactional

830
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,905
information attached
to the property.

831
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,350
And then we also,

832
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,530
do have information
that it came

833
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,970
ultimately from
graph traversal.

834
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,310
Right? So we have
a tenant list that,

835
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,530
where you where
we went from our

836
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,030
property entity to
the company entities,

837
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,455
that with the edge
types of tenants.

838
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:30,175
And then and then we also used

839
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,135
the structure,
the ownership structure,

840
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:35,195
to create an ownership tree

841
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:36,655
where we have
contact information

842
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,635
that we display in the app,

843
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:41,190
for companies and
people as you

844
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,030
as you go up that
tree away from

845
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,730
your prop your
property entities.

846
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,030
But the true power
of knowledge

847
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,330
graphs is in their
flexibility.

848
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,830
And this is where it starts to

849
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,905
get really I mean,
it's exciting so far.

850
00:29:55,985 --> 00:29:57,105
But this is where it starts to

851
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:58,165
get really exciting.

852
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,545
So so I just
showed you part of

853
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:02,625
our product that
has a property

854
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,985
centric view,
and we're looking

855
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,365
at the rest of the world,

856
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:09,365
captured by our graph,

857
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,690
from the perspective
of the property.

858
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,070
And, again,

859
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,990
this is just this
is just a this

860
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,910
is a cartoon.
This is just kind

861
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,470
of like the ownership
cartoon of of,

862
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,930
one case in our in
our in our graph.

863
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:28,275
But when you when
you have a graph,

864
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,495
you can change perspectives.

865
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,795
And what this means is that we

866
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:34,435
can take the perspective
of a company

867
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:36,275
or a person and
look at the world

868
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,715
of commercial real estate and

869
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,575
specifically look
at ownership.

870
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,370
And what this means is that

871
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,650
because of our
knowledge graph,

872
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,090
we can build
something that has

873
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,290
never been done before.

874
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,370
It does not it it didn't exist

875
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,430
before we did this.

876
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,250
And and that is
create ownership

877
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,610
portfolios covering every

878
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,770
commercial property
across the United

879
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,795
States. So what does
that look like?

880
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,075
Well, this is what
it looks like

881
00:30:58,075 --> 00:30:59,675
in the beta product
that we have

882
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,755
available to,
some of our users

883
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:05,435
currently. This is
a a company page.

884
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:06,635
So this is from the company

885
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:08,895
perspective of Spirit
Realty Capital.

886
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,470
You can see that
there are over

887
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,150
a thousand properties in their

888
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,410
portfolio. You can
look at the history

889
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,770
of the portfolio.

890
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,290
You can look at
the valuation.

891
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,690
If you you have
some information

892
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,330
about the employees,
about the company,

893
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,785
you have a breakdown
of the asset

894
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:27,165
types for the properties.

895
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,705
And then if you
wanted to go and

896
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:31,865
look at
the individual property

897
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:33,565
centric views,
you could navigate

898
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,065
to do that by clicking on this

899
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:36,605
list of properties
at the bottom.

900
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,350
I love the the map here.

901
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,470
You can see that they cover

902
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,650
the entire United
States as well.

903
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,390
And then and then, of course,

904
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,070
we can do it we
do it for people

905
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,990
as well. So so this is a this

906
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,170
is a property owner
in in Cleveland.

907
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,475
And you can see
from his property

908
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:56,055
breakdown, what he specializes

909
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,115
in is taking vacant land and

910
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,535
building small
multifamily homes,

911
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:02,215
out of them.

912
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,740
So in in summary,
right, I've I've,

913
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,280
described the motivation for

914
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,400
using knowledge graphs.

915
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
It's it's much
more than having

916
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,800
disparate data.

917
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,500
It's also capturing
the complexity

918
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,745
of human interaction
with the other

919
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:19,865
components in the graph.

920
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:22,125
It is discovering
hidden truths,

921
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:23,565
and then it's taking advantage

922
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,025
of the product
flexibility that

923
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:27,945
you can get from
a a data store

924
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:29,945
that is less opinionated and

925
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:33,245
more true to
the real world than

926
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,920
our the relational databases

927
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,040
that we have all
been using for

928
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,100
such a long time.

929
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,080
The I've talked a little bit

930
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,360
about how the knowledge graph

931
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,980
sits within
a production pipeline

932
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,575
and the choices
that the things

933
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:47,615
that you have to
think about and

934
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,135
the choices that
you have to make,

935
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:52,255
for designing and
creating those

936
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:53,155
production pipelines.

937
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:56,735
And how those
choices will affect

938
00:32:56,735 --> 00:32:57,955
your engineering performance,

939
00:32:58,015 --> 00:32:59,455
your ease of
implementation for

940
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:00,675
different types of models,

941
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:02,750
and and potentially
even affect

942
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,290
your ontology a little bit.

943
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,530
And then shown that
the flexibility

944
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,950
of a knowledge graph makes it

945
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,730
possible to create
products that

946
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,890
have not existed
before in the world.

947
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,565
And that's it. Thank
you so much for,

948
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:17,265
for joining my talk.

949
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:19,425
Happy to have all
of you there.

950
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:22,205
Thank you, Maureen.

951
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:24,545
This was a fabulous,
succinct,

952
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:27,425
powerful overview of
the entire process,

953
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,300
and it's really
nice to get that

954
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,580
from an industry perspective

955
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,540
where we're thinking about

956
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,900
production performance
and things

957
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,740
like that. So
really appreciate

958
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,420
this talk. We have a couple of

959
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,340
questions and a couple
of minutes left,

960
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,280
so I'm going to read
these quickly.

961
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,545
First one is from
Benjamin Grossoff.

962
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,605
What size ontologies are you

963
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,585
working with currently?

964
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:48,045
Not instance,
not actual data,

965
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:49,725
but just the size
of the ontology

966
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:51,345
in terms of entity classes,

967
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:53,745
edge relation types,
that kind of thing.

968
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,090
So I,

969
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,270
we consider our
ontology a little

970
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,030
bit proprietary
because there's

971
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,030
a lot of nuance
in the CRE space

972
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,390
and there's a lot of nuance in

973
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,815
the in the business space.

974
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:08,935
So I'm not like,

975
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:10,455
we don't typically
share, like,

976
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:12,135
numbers or create
a list of something,

977
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:15,975
which is why I showed
a cartoon of of,

978
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,595
like, what what
the ownership,

979
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:19,575
part of the graph
would look like.

980
00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:20,855
So I don't know that I can go

981
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,510
into a lot of detail there.

982
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,270
Is there such
a thing as, like,

983
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,530
a range of what's
sort of typical

984
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,390
without, you know,

985
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,390
asking about
proprietary just as,

986
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,390
like, a ballpark
for someone who

987
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,290
has no idea?

988
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,770
I I think that
the the ontology

989
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,675
really is really
dependent on,

990
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:42,855
whether you're
trying to capture

991
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:45,175
an entire industry or whether

992
00:34:45,175 --> 00:34:47,015
you're trying to capture maybe

993
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,395
a subset of an industry.

994
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,175
So if you're if
you're building

995
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:53,360
an ontology, for example,

996
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,360
one that I've heard,

997
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,200
several times now is,

998
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,280
building an ontology
for for medicine,

999
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,660
you would probably
start with,

1000
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,095
like, a subset of
of of medicine

1001
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:09,395
and look at interactions and

1002
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:10,675
look at adverse events.

1003
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,815
And and,

1004
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:14,515
so your your ontology could be

1005
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:17,235
much smaller than
something that

1006
00:35:17,235 --> 00:35:19,810
that is trying to
capture the entire

1007
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,570
world of, I don't know,

1008
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,950
medical knowledge and,

1009
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,990
instruments as
well as medicines

1010
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,490
and met you know,

1011
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,270
different techniques
and hospitals

1012
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,370
and all and all of that.

1013
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,430
So it's,

1014
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,755
the ontology
should be designed

1015
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:37,455
for should be
designed to cover

1016
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:39,135
the the the product and all

1017
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:40,575
the product use cases.

1018
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:45,615
And and by that,

1019
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:48,050
I don't mean that it should be

1020
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,510
restrictive.
There's definitely,

1021
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,510
kind of,

1022
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,210
creativity that you wanna take

1023
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,110
advantage of.

1024
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,915
And and there's an element of

1025
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,995
discovery in in in creating

1026
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,135
these knowledge graphs.

1027
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:06,115
So you you definitely can

1028
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:07,395
anticipate
everything that that

1029
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:08,435
you would wanna capture.

1030
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:09,955
So it's better more more is

1031
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:10,935
better than less.

1032
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:15,630
And, but, yeah,
it's really hard.

1033
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,070
So so, you know, at
a previous position,

1034
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,110
I I we were we
built a knowledge

1035
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,590
graph and, one of the things

1036
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,670
that we're looking
at was bad actors,

1037
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,350
and we're looking at
money laundering.

1038
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,415
And, you can
identify bad actors

1039
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:32,455
just by having,

1040
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:36,615
person entities
and by having,

1041
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,055
company entities.

1042
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,635
Like and that's
and that's it.

1043
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,175
And it's and it's
the structures

1044
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,330
of the graph
fragments that you

1045
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,950
get that allow
you to identify,

1046
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,110
oh, this person's
a money launderer.

1047
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,210
Right. It's it's
almost because

1048
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,630
you bring in
the interpretative context.

1049
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,650
Right? So if, you know,

1050
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,325
you have someone
who is associated

1051
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:00,805
with Bernie Madoff's
company, like,

1052
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:02,825
you know, this is
not a good thing.

1053
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:04,725
Sure. Or or someone that's

1054
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,605
associated with, many,

1055
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,925
many different companies in or

1056
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:11,850
and has not just
associated, but,

1057
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,890
like, created many,

1058
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,170
many different
companies in a short

1059
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,070
amount of time.

1060
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,650
That's something
that you don't

1061
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,170
typically see with
someone who's

1062
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,290
trying to build a business.

1063
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,410
That's something that you see

1064
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,090
with somebody who is trying to

1065
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,770
do bad things. And,

1066
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,795
and especially if
they're in a cluster

1067
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:29,535
with a a handful
of other people,

1068
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:35,035
that are that are also doing

1069
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,015
the same behavior,

1070
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:38,770
it's it's so different than

1071
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,930
the normal human behavior that

1072
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,850
that you see that
it just really

1073
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,910
leaps out at you.

1074
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,630
So it's the pattern
really that

1075
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,090
is exposed. So I think there's

1076
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,190
time maybe for one
last question.

1077
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,345
If this isn't proprietary,

1078
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,565
what was your
very first follow

1079
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,425
the money business use case,

1080
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:02,205
if that's also
clear? Yeah. Yeah.

1081
00:38:02,205 --> 00:38:04,205
So so a really I mean,

1082
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,225
a really big one was,

1083
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,490
a really big one
was these owner

1084
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,250
portfolios. And, you know,

1085
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,690
we've been working on creating

1086
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,010
the owner portfolios for for

1087
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,290
over a year, for about a for

1088
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,510
about a year and a half.

1089
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:22,885
And, but but Reonomy
has had resolved,

1090
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:26,305
property entities
for for quite

1091
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,025
some time, many,
many years now.

1092
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:33,590
And, so I think that
the the creation

1093
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,290
of graph structures
is motivated

1094
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,530
even before we
decided to go after,

1095
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,050
owner portfolios.

1096
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,950
The the motivation of graph

1097
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,650
usage was motivated
by the complexity

1098
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,490
and the ownership structures

1099
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,570
that we see in in the US.
