1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,420
Hi, everyone. I'm
Kendall Clark,

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,280
CEO and cofounder at Stardog.

3
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:13,045
I'm pleased to be talking with

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,665
you today at the twenty twenty

5
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:16,585
knowledge connections
conference.

6
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,245
I've been working in knowledge

7
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:19,605
graphs and AI since nineteen

8
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:20,885
ninety nine in a variety of

9
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,325
roles from r and d,

10
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,345
standards work at
the w three c,

11
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:25,605
to building a knowledge graph

12
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:26,665
startup at Stardog.

13
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,910
Today, I'm going to be talking

14
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,290
with you about
the disconnected

15
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,970
data world in which
we find ourselves,

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,330
how we got here,

17
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,830
and the path that I can see to

18
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,890
get us out of it.

19
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,550
I know you are
all familiar with

20
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,850
the data silo problem,

21
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,350
but I think it's helpful to

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,285
reexamine it, break it down to

23
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:44,065
see how it has
evolved over time

24
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:45,805
to help us better address it

25
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:46,545
going forward.

26
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:49,885
The future we're all driving

27
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:51,085
towards in the knowledge graph

28
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,105
community is the connected
enterprise,

29
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,340
A way of managing data,

30
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,940
no matter its type or location

31
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,420
or format, to connect it where

32
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,680
it's most useful at
the compute layer,

33
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,500
and to connect it in the way

34
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,180
that's most useful
based on what

35
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,360
it means, not on
its location.

36
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:10,845
We at Startog are to our core

37
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,365
concerned with this issue of

38
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,505
bringing the differentiated

39
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:15,265
power of semantic
graph technology

40
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,045
to enterprise data to solve

41
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,345
the data silo problem.

42
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,930
And today, I'm going to share

43
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,290
with you several new features

44
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,290
of the startup
platform that are

45
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,450
taking us to the next step in

46
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,290
connecting data in what is

47
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,370
increasingly
a hybrid and multi

48
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,845
cloud world. Finally,

49
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,045
I'll be leaving about ten or

50
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,245
fifteen minutes for questions

51
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:37,385
at the end of my talk,

52
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,725
and I'm really looking forward

53
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,745
to hearing those
and and speaking

54
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:41,865
with you directly.

55
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:44,985
So before we dive in,

56
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,285
let's take a little
bit talk a little

57
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:48,985
bit about who we
are at Stardog.

58
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,940
Stardog is
the leading enterprise

59
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,000
knowledge graph platform.

60
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,740
While many graph vendors focus

61
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,680
on graph for better
data storage,

62
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
we focus on applying graph for

63
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,280
better data management.

64
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,900
We have customers
all over the world,

65
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,720
but primarily in the e
EU and in the US,

66
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:06,565
and those clients are focused

67
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:08,025
in a few select industries,

68
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,465
health care and
life sciences,

69
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:12,505
financial services,
and manufacturing.

70
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,765
So I'll begin this
talk with a little

71
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:16,665
history lesson.

72
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,240
Digital transformation,

73
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,900
in addition to
being, of course,

74
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,260
an overused term that makes us

75
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,960
all groan or or
roll our eyes,

76
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,040
has actually become
very relevant,

77
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,420
in this long awful
pandemic year

78
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,400
of twenty twenty.

79
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,940
When I started in
AI and knowledge

80
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,425
graphs, this move to
digital was new,

81
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,265
and it was already
hard enough.

82
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,405
And that was in the purely

83
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:39,365
relational world,

84
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,645
the world before the web,

85
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,105
before the commercial
Internet,

86
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:43,605
when the problem was,

87
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,445
mostly just a bunch
of relational

88
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,750
databases that lived in an on

89
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,810
prem data center.

90
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,350
What's happened since then?

91
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,550
In particular, what's happened

92
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,850
to data landscape?

93
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,250
Well, a lot's
happened, of course.

94
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,990
First, the nature
of enterprise

95
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,530
data has changed
dramatically.

96
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:01,645
Today, we deal with data that

97
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:03,165
is structured.
Yes, of course,

98
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,605
but also unstructured and semi

99
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:06,365
structured. The
enterprise data

100
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,965
landscape is highly subject to

101
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,565
change as the rate of data

102
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,925
collection has
accelerated with

103
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,585
the exponential
growth of networks.

104
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,730
First broadband
and now of course

105
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,210
five g. And as businesses have

106
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,870
grown bigger and
become more complex,

107
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,690
and for many of
today's leading

108
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,230
companies, their
core intellectual

109
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,310
property really has
become their data.

110
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,235
What we've been
calling the data

111
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,555
silo problem has
actually gotten

112
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:31,455
a lot worse.

113
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,775
According to a recent survey,

114
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:35,755
forty percent of
companies that

115
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,695
consider themselves
data driven

116
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,015
have more than fifty core

117
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,860
disconnected data silos.

118
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
The data silos
strictly speaking

119
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,140
are problematic.

120
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
Data separated at the storage

121
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
layer allows for local control

122
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,700
and governance,

123
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,540
which businesses
of course need.

124
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,255
Often data separation
is is a requirement

125
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:55,555
of policy and compliance.

126
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,435
However, in our interconnected

127
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,515
complex fast moving world,

128
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,895
maximizing the value of data

129
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,435
requires connecting it.

130
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:06,255
A business with loads of data

131
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,855
and lots of disconnected data

132
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,910
silos is really no
more intelligent

133
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,350
and therefore no
more adaptable

134
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,870
to change, able
to take advantage

135
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,930
of new market opportunities,

136
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,990
or more responsive to customer

137
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,330
needs than
the purely relational

138
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,570
on prem data center businesses

139
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,110
that ruled the world
just twenty

140
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,930
years ago.

141
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,365
And this is only looking at

142
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,285
the problem purely
from the business

143
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,965
perspective. When
we start looking

144
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,725
at the problem as experienced

145
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,665
by boots on the ground
data people,

146
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:35,505
the people who need
to operationalize

147
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,165
all this stuff and stitch all

148
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,625
these different
pieces together,

149
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
the complexity
of the data data

150
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,460
silo problem just increases.

151
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
For better or for worse,

152
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,220
this is the nature
of the beast.

153
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,600
Enterprise data
will either save

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,825
us all or well,
it'll save us all,

155
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:53,945
but only if it doesn't kill us

156
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,425
all first. As
the world develops

157
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,565
new ways to communicate,

158
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,985
businesses will have new types

159
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,605
of data to mine for insight.

160
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:02,265
But for us data folks,

161
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:03,705
we'll have a new data problem

162
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,645
to try to connect
into the hole.

163
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,040
And I haven't even
started talking

164
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,140
yet about the data
location issue.

165
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,100
Alright. So that brings
us to the cloud.

166
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,080
let's talk about
the cloud a bit

167
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,360
because it's starting to seem

168
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
like people think the cloud

169
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,580
could be magic.

170
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:21,205
But we data people,

171
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,825
we don't believe in magic.

172
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,825
So the cloud is happening.

173
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,645
It's been happening
for, what,

174
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:27,785
ten, fifteen years.

175
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,025
How is the cloud's development

176
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,925
impacting the evolution
of the data

177
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:32,985
management landscape?

178
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,890
We started with
the business and

179
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,330
its on prem data
center full of

180
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,230
relational databases,

181
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,210
and then this data
center started

182
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,730
filling up with
data silos full

183
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,890
of different kinds of data,

184
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,030
data of different types.

185
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,090
Now we add to that a remote

186
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,195
cloud data center.

187
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:48,895
And, yeah, the same phenomenon

188
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:51,035
of varying data
types piling up

189
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,395
in different data silos is

190
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,455
happening there too.

191
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,315
While moving data to the cloud

192
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,215
has many benefits,

193
00:05:57,915 --> 00:05:59,835
better connecting your data is

194
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:01,055
not one of them.

195
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,240
There are many
different flavors

196
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,160
to cloud implementations
as well.

197
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,180
There's, of course,

198
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,860
the public cloud where cloud

199
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,620
resources are accessed
via the public

200
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,860
Internet, and there's
private cloud,

201
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,380
which is dedicated to a single

202
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,840
organization with
the infrastructure

203
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,200
located somewhere.

204
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:17,625
maybe it's, in fact,

205
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,225
better that we
don't know actually

206
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,005
where, but it's not accessible

207
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,125
to the public Internet.

208
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,465
And there's hybrid cloud,

209
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,145
which is a combination of both

210
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,125
public and private.

211
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,625
Now for software vendors and

212
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,505
business leaders,

213
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,480
the CEO or CFO perhaps,

214
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,940
Hybrid clearly is
the best option.

215
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,100
It offers the ease,
scalability,

216
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,080
and access to the catalog of

217
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,000
apps that is the hallmark of

218
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the public cloud while also

219
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,780
providing the security,
performance,

220
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,065
and cost saving benefits that

221
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:49,605
characterize
the private cloud.

222
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:52,225
It even lets
organizations migrate

223
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,445
to the cloud piecemeal.

224
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:55,585
That's great. In fact,

225
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:57,025
you've probably
started to notice

226
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,085
in your own organization,

227
00:06:58,145 --> 00:06:59,925
especially if it's
particularly large,

228
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,450
that there has been
a bit of a pendulum

229
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,450
effect lately here with

230
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,970
organizations going all in on

231
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,570
the cloud and now
starting some

232
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,770
of them to swing back towards

233
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,930
the private cloud
and even growing

234
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,770
talk about repatriation or

235
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,090
repatriating some
of their cloud

236
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,415
data assets from public
back to private.

237
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,035
Either way, the cloud is here

238
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,655
to stay no matter
what incarnation

239
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:23,495
it takes. We all
understand that.

240
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,275
And honestly, all of that is

241
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,715
probably complex enough.

242
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,475
Right? But, alas,

243
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:30,915
we have one more
turn of the screw

244
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,290
to consider. the place where

245
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,870
the world is headed
isn't the cloud,

246
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,290
one magical place where all

247
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,910
the data is already
connected.

248
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,150
The place we're
headed is hybrid

249
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,370
multi cloud. Now
I just told you

250
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,915
about hybrid,
public and private.

251
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,675
Now let's take take a look at

252
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,615
the final driver
for complexity,

253
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,135
the multi cloud part.

254
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,075
There are now, I
think by my count,

255
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,995
by all claim,
four cloud vendors

256
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:57,475
that really matter,
at least next year.

257
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:58,755
Next year, who knows?

258
00:07:58,755 --> 00:07:59,975
Maybe there'll be five.

259
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,530
So we, the data people,

260
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,970
have also got the diversity of

261
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,150
the cloud vendor
offerings to deal with,

262
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,670
a w AWS, of course,
Azure, GCP,

263
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,870
and now Oracle.

264
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,930
In all likelihood,

265
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,470
if you work for
a big organization,

266
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,435
you have a vendor
that your org

267
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:16,955
picked for public cloud and

268
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,235
maybe a different vendor that

269
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:20,335
you use for some
legacy assets,

270
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,835
and then perhaps a third that

271
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,115
was brought into the mix when

272
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,655
you acquired a competitor.

273
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:28,360
Even worse, this multi cloud

274
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,880
phenomenon is not
something that

275
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,660
defines only large
enterprises.

276
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,220
Up to ninety percent
of all businesses,

277
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,020
including small and
medium sized ones,

278
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,780
use more than one cloud.

279
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,275
Or as we should say,

280
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,975
we should really say
us data people.

281
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:44,035
They have data assets in more

282
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,015
than one cloud.

283
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,875
Just as with
the flexibility and

284
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,095
hybrid cloud considerations,

285
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:50,755
there are benefits to choosing

286
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,975
multiple cloud providers,

287
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,090
like avoiding vendor lock in,

288
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,450
getting the right
tool for the right

289
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,510
problem, resiliency.

290
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,950
But proliferating disconnected

291
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,950
assets across multi clouds

292
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,670
represents an old
familiar problem,

293
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,190
difficulty
with interoperability

294
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,135
and governance and portability

295
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,095
and management.

296
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,075
And in reality,

297
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,075
all of this cloud
complexity is

298
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,415
making the data silo
problem worse,

299
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:17,715
not better, which
in turn makes

300
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:19,495
digital transformation
harder,

301
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:20,615
not easier.

302
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,600
In the hybrid multi
cloud world,

303
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,520
data is more
physically separated,

304
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,600
making it difficult to unify,

305
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,160
which makes it even
harder to connect.

306
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,220
And of course, public cloud

307
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,080
vendors understand
this very well,

308
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,505
and so they're charging in and

309
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,165
out fees and other,
approaches,

310
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,225
charging you every time you

311
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,685
consolidate data physically.

312
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,425
They certainly want your

313
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,125
organization to
be very happy,

314
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:48,805
but only within their
walled garden.

315
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,440
And it gets better.

316
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,600
Data is not often
easily extractable

317
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,440
from prepackaged
SaaS applications,

318
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,300
which rarely
provide real access

319
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,220
to the underlining
to the underlying

320
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,960
data storage.

321
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,940
I think by this point,

322
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,220
I've conveyed the extent of

323
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,920
the problem of
disconnected data

324
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,055
and that the slope
of this curve

325
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,835
is really getting worse.

326
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,535
The problem has
only compounded

327
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:12,895
over the years
as these amazing

328
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,055
new technologies
have made data

329
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:17,315
people wanna tear
their hair out.

330
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
I know I'm preaching
to the choir here,

331
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,560
but it's important
to understand

332
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
how we got to this place if

333
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,400
we're going to
figure out the best

334
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,140
way forward.

335
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,720
So let's pause
for a second and

336
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
reground ourselves in why we

337
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,340
have all this data
to begin with.

338
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,615
Perhaps that seems
like a silly

339
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:36,395
thing to do especially
at this event,

340
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,815
but with any problem,

341
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:39,015
you need to figure
out where you

342
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:40,935
want to be at
the end if you're

343
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,235
going to make real progress.

344
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:46,510
So I think we have
data for insight.

345
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,390
We integrate it, mash
it up, model it,

346
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,830
transform it for the purposes

347
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,590
of deriving new knowledge.

348
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,570
Whether our job is to optimize

349
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,250
a business process to increase

350
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,990
profits or to
develop a vaccine

351
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,750
to a deadly pandemic,

352
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:03,225
Data serves the ends of human

353
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:05,145
knowledge and know
how or really

354
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,525
what's the point of it.

355
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,225
I'm reminded here
of Metcalfe's law,

356
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,365
the network effect,

357
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,585
that the bigger and
denser a network

358
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,845
becomes, the more
valuable it is.

359
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,980
Now that means there's a kind

360
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,900
of jujitsu move available to

361
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,820
enterprises if
we can help them

362
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,060
pull it off. We can't actually

363
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,920
go from the awful unproductive

364
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,300
data silo problem to a value

365
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,220
creation network inside every

366
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,040
large enterprise,

367
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,165
But that's only going to be

368
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:34,325
possible if we're
able if you're

369
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:36,325
able to make these
value creating

370
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:37,865
connections in the data.

371
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,565
Now clearly,
especially at this

372
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,665
conference, this is
a graph problem.

373
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,425
You all already know this.

374
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,350
Now the great news,
and frankly,

375
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,070
if you're like me,

376
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,590
we all want some
more good news

377
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,350
this year, is that
people outside

378
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,710
of our community are starting

379
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,070
to realize that
this is a graph

380
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,410
problem too. I'll
give you an example.

381
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,170
Back in April, we saw Gartner

382
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,210
publish the headline,

383
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,355
COVID nineteen demands urgent

384
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,035
use of graph data
management and

385
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:05,035
analytics, and
they've continued

386
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:06,395
to advocate for
the adoption of

387
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,835
data fabrics of
which knowledge

388
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:09,295
graphs form a core part.

389
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,435
Now I'm really pleased to see

390
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:12,940
the increased
adoption of graph

391
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,400
in the market and
the acknowledgment

392
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,620
of of its power
to address some

393
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,140
of the biggest
problems plaguing

394
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,960
data management,

395
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,040
including the data
silo problem.

396
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,800
But a graph database,

397
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,620
no matter what
variety of graph

398
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,345
database, in and
of itself will

399
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,865
not solve the complex problem

400
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,405
I've been describing so far.

401
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,305
We need to go
where the data is

402
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:33,385
and layer over data graph

403
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,305
capabilities that
can adapt with

404
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:35,965
the business.

405
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,680
Now as I said at
the beginning,

406
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,700
the future we
envision at StarDog,

407
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,120
and I think I speak in this

408
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,820
sense for the whole
community here,

409
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,260
is the connected enterprise.

410
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,560
And we don't just
talk about it,

411
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,020
but we're helping
our customers

412
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,700
achieve it, through StarDog,

413
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,225
our data platform,

414
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,565
including a third generation

415
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,865
virtualization engine,

416
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,705
an expanding
connector universe,

417
00:12:57,085 --> 00:12:58,845
and the recently
announced StarDog

418
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,925
Cloud. Now I wanna
spend some,

419
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:02,525
time and the rest of this talk

420
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,610
diving into each one
of these in turn.

421
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,570
Now for us, virtualization has

422
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,010
been key to StarDog's product

423
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,550
vision since our inception.

424
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,190
Data virtualization
as a capability

425
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,690
in the relational data model

426
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,990
world is not new,

427
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,810
but StarDog has been a leader

428
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,870
in graph virtualization.

429
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,685
As I said, we're now building

430
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,205
the third generation virtual

431
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,885
graph engine
inside the StartUp

432
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,225
platform with lots
of innovation

433
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,685
still to come. We call this

434
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,305
capability virtual graphs,

435
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,700
and it's special
made for varied

436
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,480
data with
conflicting definitions

437
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,300
or changing schemas or uneven

438
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,220
properties, just the type of

439
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,980
data you encounter daily in

440
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,640
the enterprise.

441
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,580
Now two features of startup's

442
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,245
virtualization capability in

443
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,365
particular here stand out,

444
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:49,865
and I wanna share them
with you briefly.

445
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,325
First, Stardog virtual graphs

446
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:55,225
or are what we call
schema multi tenant,

447
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,205
which means that many schemas

448
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:58,825
or models can
exist simultaneously

449
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,105
inside of Stardog.

450
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,780
But this as we all know,

451
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,460
there is isn't
ever going to be

452
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,000
one schema for
the whole enterprise.

453
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,140
And all those
schemas and models

454
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,980
can exist at the storage and

455
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,600
compute layers of
the platform.

456
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,460
Second, startup virtual graphs

457
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,980
also offer what
we call virtual

458
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,455
transparency, which
means the platform

459
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:18,975
is able to answer queries over

460
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,495
all the connected data silos

461
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:21,615
that feed into the start of

462
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,375
enterprise knowledge
graph without

463
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,135
anyone having to know exactly

464
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:27,155
where any of the data
really lives.

465
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:29,295
We call that connecting data

466
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,375
based on what it
means at the compute

467
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,610
layer and not at
the storage layer.

468
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,950
And we think that's key to

469
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,470
thriving in the hybrid multi

470
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,830
cloud world. And
we're not done yet.

471
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,190
We're pushing
the envelope here

472
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,810
with upcoming
platform releases,

473
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,710
and I'm going to dive
into the details

474
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,830
of some of those and and tell

475
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,050
you about them first.

476
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:48,515
But before I do that,

477
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:49,875
let me bucket them here to get

478
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,075
us started and
just say they'll

479
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,695
come in about four different,

480
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,275
categories. First,

481
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,495
scalability and performance.

482
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:57,655
Second, convenience
and usability.

483
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,695
Third, resilience.

484
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:01,015
Fourth, expressivity
and reach.

485
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,310
So first, let's talk about

486
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,450
scalability and performance.

487
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,390
We started
replatforming StarDog

488
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,670
as a software system of about

489
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,430
a million lines of code from

490
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,510
pure Java to Kubernetes about

491
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,350
two years ago, and the payoff

492
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,130
is really starting
to arrive now.

493
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,905
The scale and
performance of our

494
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,605
virtual graph service
is increasing

495
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,505
dramatically in
Kubernetes with

496
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:22,285
its elastic scaling ability.

497
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:23,785
In upcoming releases,

498
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:25,065
the system will pull data from

499
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:26,665
data silos to be
stored in local

500
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:27,945
cache nodes that
are managed by

501
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:30,440
Kubernetes. This
scalability is

502
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,420
created dynamically,

503
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
and it's based on latency and

504
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,300
throughput requirements,

505
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,460
and it's continuously updated

506
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,980
to minimize stale data.

507
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,880
This is leading
us to see about

508
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,060
a five fold speed
up and performance

509
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,220
in virtual graphs in startup.

510
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,295
Not only is is that the result

511
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,755
of of moving to Kubernetes,

512
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,575
but it's also the result of

513
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,255
continuous innovation
in the query

514
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,095
translation and
execution process

515
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,315
internal to the system.

516
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:55,815
We're starting to see in many

517
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:57,595
benchmarks virtual
graph performance

518
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,450
matching, the performance of

519
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,750
queries on local data.

520
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,650
We've also improved
handling and

521
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,010
intermediate query
results from

522
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,890
virtual graphs,

523
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,170
and we're storing
those results

524
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,450
in such a way as to minimize

525
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,930
system pauses and avoid out of

526
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,055
memory errors, and the like.

527
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:14,675
And we've
improved materialization

528
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,035
performance as well.

529
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:17,375
The now the result of all this

530
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,135
is that when
dealing with large

531
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,835
data sources and
results sets,

532
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,655
these changes
dramatically import

533
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,735
improve performance in real

534
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,715
world use cases.

535
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,130
Now it's also leading to much

536
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,490
better performance
of the virtual

537
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,170
transparency capability I told

538
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,930
you about before to better

539
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,810
optimize virtual queries over

540
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,030
many data sources.

541
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,430
Now second, convenience
and usability,

542
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,455
improvements, especially for

543
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,075
enterprise scale use cases.

544
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:45,215
Now as many of you know,

545
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:46,335
when you bring a new capable

546
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,855
capability into the market,

547
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,535
it's typical to focus first on

548
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,295
making it work and making it

549
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:53,475
work fast and then
making it easy.

550
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,300
We've also been
working hard on

551
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,420
convenience and usability of

552
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,640
StartOgg's graph
virtualization.

553
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,820
I'll mention a few areas of,

554
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,280
improvement briefly.

555
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,920
First, we've made
the virtualization

556
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,260
of StartOgg work better with

557
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,960
the StartOgg cluster for high

558
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:09,625
availability and scale,

559
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:11,285
including optimizing how we

560
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,905
handle and distribute
the metadata

561
00:17:13,045 --> 00:17:14,805
about data silos that StarDog

562
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:15,465
is connecting.

563
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:17,625
Faster, more
resilient metadata

564
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,465
ingestion means
StarDog users,

565
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,305
get their job done faster.

566
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,150
Second, we've also introduced

567
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,830
finer grained access control

568
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,530
over the virtualized
data sources.

569
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,590
Now the access
control rules for

570
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,210
a data source can be specified

571
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,470
separately from the virtual

572
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,890
graphs created over
those data sources.

573
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,245
That means access
control policies

574
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,665
can be set once perhaps
by IT security,

575
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,325
and then all the rest
of the start

576
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:43,245
up knowledge graph abides by

577
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:43,985
those policies.

578
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:45,965
And that leads
to better access

579
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:46,945
control sooner.

580
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,345
In fact, most
start up customers

581
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,500
link these policies
to existing

582
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,440
active directory
and LDAP groups

583
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,340
so that the existing role

584
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,940
hierarchy in
the enterprise will

585
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,220
be leveraged and respected

586
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,460
automatically.
Start up connect

587
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,980
silos no matter
where we find them,

588
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,360
including IT security.

589
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:05,605
Next, we've improved
resilience.

590
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,145
One thing we
quickly learned in

591
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,505
the first generation virtual

592
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,125
graph engine inside of Stardog

593
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,865
is that a database
somewhere in

594
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,145
the enterprise
that's connected

595
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:16,245
via Stardog may be misbehaving

596
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:17,685
or poorly connected.

597
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,280
And, yeah, you guessed it,

598
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,600
startup users
blame startup such

599
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,260
as life.

600
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,580
So we've also worked
hard recently

601
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,100
to increase platform
resilience,

602
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,400
especially when handling slow

603
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,700
external data sources.

604
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,085
When a downstream data source

605
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,785
is unusually slow to respond,

606
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,165
that affects query
times and latency,

607
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,765
and in extreme
cases results in

608
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:40,085
timeouts, which
is a bad customer

609
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,565
experience. Recently,

610
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,005
we've improved how we handle

611
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,950
these cases so as not to waste

612
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,270
cluster resources or to affect

613
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,870
other work occurring
in the start

614
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,790
up cluster. Connections and

615
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,310
queries to external
sources are

616
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,990
now retried automatically to

617
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,590
work around
intermittent issues

618
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,950
and provide a better customer

619
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,115
experience. Finally,

620
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,795
we've improved
the expressivity

621
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,535
and reach of our virtual graph

622
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:06,775
capability to include text and

623
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,875
geospatial indexing
of data silos.

624
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,615
StartUp now extends text and

625
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,930
geospatial indexing
over virtual

626
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,990
graph data sources.

627
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,730
These indexes are updated

628
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,650
seamlessly and
automatically so

629
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,410
that full text search and

630
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,270
geospatial queries
can be executed

631
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,430
at the compute
layer in StarDog

632
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,350
without requiring modification

633
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,705
of the data in
the storage layer

634
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,745
externally. And
StarDog has also

635
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:34,185
recently expanded the universe

636
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:36,205
of sources you can
connect to virtually.

637
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,585
We've provided graph virtual

638
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:39,785
graph connectors for core

639
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:41,980
databases for
quite some time.

640
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,200
But now we offer
virtual graphs

641
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,360
capability connectors to about

642
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,460
forty or fifty of
the most common

643
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,580
enterprise applications.

644
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,880
And we think in the connected

645
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,315
enterprise data
sources like HubSpot,

646
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,715
Salesforce, Eloqua,

647
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:00,875
and SAP matter just
as much as Oracle,

648
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:02,875
Postgres, and MongoDB.

649
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,000
A big focus for
us going forward

650
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
is connecting enterprise data

651
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,660
silos that aren't databases,

652
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,180
but rather they're APIs,

653
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,580
cloud based SaaS
apps, and more.

654
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
You can, actually
head over and

655
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
see a full list of
this expanded,

656
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,520
virtual graph
connected universe

657
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,820
at start up dot com.

658
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:20,715
We've made this
investment because

659
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,475
we take our mission
to go wherever

660
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,475
the data is and
connect it quite

661
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,475
seriously. The hybrid multi

662
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,235
cloud world needs
a cost effective

663
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,755
way to connect and query all

664
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:31,455
the data sources in
the enterprise.

665
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,360
And that means I'm especially

666
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,220
excited to share
this next step

667
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,180
on that journey.

668
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
About two weeks ago,

669
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,100
we quietly announced
startup cloud,

670
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,100
the first cloud
native enterprise

671
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,300
knowledge graph platform.

672
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,665
Now not only do we connect all

673
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,185
on prem data, but
we also connect

674
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:50,125
data in and from
the cloud too.

675
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,145
Again, the real driving force

676
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,665
behind this launch is the need

677
00:20:54,665 --> 00:20:56,125
for end to end connectivity

678
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:58,605
across the entire enterprise

679
00:20:58,905 --> 00:20:59,805
data ecosystem.

680
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,590
Now that so many organizations

681
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,970
are moving so much
data to the cloud,

682
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,590
to the hybrid multi cloud,

683
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,210
start StartUp is
following them

684
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,970
there to help them
connect those

685
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,650
sources to the ones
they already

686
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,110
have connected on prem.

687
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,965
Startup cloud is
deployed as a managed

688
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,885
service and offers
all the benefits

689
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,885
of all the benefits
that benefits

690
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:22,585
that you've come
to expect from

691
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,185
cloud based data management,

692
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:25,705
twenty four seven application

693
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:27,860
monitoring, service level

694
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,360
guaranteed uptime,
automatic updates,

695
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,040
elastically scalable
infrastructure.

696
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,940
You can deploy it
in your private

697
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,220
cloud or in hybrid cloud

698
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,320
environments and
easily connects

699
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,880
all all on prem and
cloud data sources.

700
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,245
I'm, really super
excited about

701
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:43,525
this launch of StartUp Cloud.

702
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,285
Like I said, we
released it just

703
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,005
a few weeks ago,

704
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,285
and I can't wait
to see what our

705
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:48,405
early adopters, friends,

706
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:50,905
and customers do with
this new service.

707
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:51,945
Okay.

708
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
So I've been talking now for

709
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,220
about twenty minutes,

710
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,640
which means I haven't learned

711
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,980
anything new in at
least twenty minutes.

712
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,560
I'd like to conclude my talk

713
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,480
today first by
thanking you for

714
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,980
attending, your
virtual attendance

715
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,725
and attention to my talk about

716
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:07,845
In part in part for that

717
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:09,865
virtualization is
a is a delightful

718
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,505
irony that I'm happy to note.

719
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,245
we have a lot of
exciting stuff

720
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,205
going on at StarDog,

721
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,405
and it's really a pleasure to

722
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,925
share it and really share some

723
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,610
of it first with
you all today.

724
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,210
We think you're the frontline

725
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,330
in this effort to wrangle

726
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,090
enterprise data into
useful control,

727
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,530
and our goal at
Start aug is to

728
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,230
make that job easier for you.

729
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,690
And when your job
is easier and

730
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,530
you can fully
connect data across

731
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,230
types and locations
and vendors,

732
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:36,175
across all these various data

733
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,695
silos I've talked
about today,

734
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,555
you can deliver
better insights

735
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:40,675
to your organization.

736
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:42,975
In the end, that's
what the startup

737
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,015
is really all about.

738
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:44,895
And I think it's what this

739
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:46,355
community is
really all about,

740
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:48,415
actionable knowledge
to make a better

741
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:50,700
world. This year
of twenty twenty

742
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,440
has fully demonstrated
the importance

743
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,580
of connected data.

744
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,080
The world in which we live is

745
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,780
complicated, intertwined,

746
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,140
rapidly evolving,

747
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,960
and everyone who studies these

748
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,240
trends think
they're just going

749
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,300
to accelerate.

750
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:04,605
In an interconnected world,

751
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:06,145
we need connected data.

752
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:09,185
Well, I think we
here all know,

753
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:10,785
data is interconnected.

754
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:13,005
So perhaps more precisely,
I should say,

755
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:14,445
we need to be
able to see these

756
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:15,805
interconnections because then

757
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,985
we can predict things
that might happen.

758
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,990
Then we can be
more resilient,

759
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,350
more effective,

760
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,250
and more able to conquer all

761
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,950
the challenges
that lie ahead.

762
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,710
Thank you.

763
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,990
can you elaborate
on Stardog Studio?

764
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,870
sure. Happy to. hi, Olivier.

765
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:16,905
Startup studio is our,

766
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:19,005
IDE integrated development

767
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,245
environment for implementing

768
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:22,525
start up applications.

769
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:23,545
And so it's,

770
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:26,105
really a programmer's
tool that

771
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,930
has support for
all of the core

772
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,610
languages that make
up the knowledge

773
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,810
graph stack,
Sparkle, Shackle,

774
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,970
RDF, OWL, our rule syntax,

775
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,625
our mapping syntax,
all of those bits.

776
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:42,925
it is a web
application available

777
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,225
at start dot studio.

778
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,525
I'm not sure who
was responsible

779
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:48,125
for that global
top level domain,

780
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,065
but we're we're taking
advantage of it.

781
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:52,685
and that's available
for use for free.

782
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:55,190
It's it's part of
our product suite,

783
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,570
but it's, a free tool
for anyone to use.

784
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,950
And it is also on the way to

785
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,350
migrating to become
the beginning

786
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,270
of the user interface
for the start

787
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,250
on cloud product.

788
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:09,205
And I'll I'll just say briefly

789
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,345
some of the what
we're focusing

790
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:13,745
heavily on this
tool to move it

791
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,145
from being purely a sort of

792
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:18,885
software developer ID kind of

793
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,610
platform to being much more

794
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,170
visual with the mutual support

795
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,250
for search and
query as well as

796
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,450
the mapping as well as mapping

797
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,970
and modeling, and that should

798
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,730
be start being available in

799
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,830
January February of
this next year.

800
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:40,965
Great. another question from

801
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:42,485
Pallavi Karant.

802
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:46,385
Yeah. Would like to know if

803
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:48,245
reasoning on
multishema graphs.

804
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,570
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

805
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,550
I can see the question.

806
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,290
good good morning.

807
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,610
Good afternoon,
Pallavi. yeah.

808
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,530
So I talked about
the scheme of

809
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,470
multi tenancy in start,

810
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,770
which is just the idea that

811
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,075
there isn't one
schema in a startup

812
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:06,955
knowledge graph.

813
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:09,035
There may be many
and that these

814
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,555
are independent of each other

815
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:13,375
and in fact they
may be inconsistent

816
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:14,235
with each other.

817
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:16,895
They may one schema
may have a definition

818
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,515
of important concept or a rule

819
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:22,410
that's quite at
odds with that.

820
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,510
A definition of a concept or

821
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,390
rule in another schema,

822
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,090
and that's just perfectly fine

823
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,290
and reasoning.

824
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,335
in start of takes
account of or

825
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,335
uses the definitions in one of

826
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:37,735
those schemas. So
that's the reason

827
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:40,375
they're sort of separated
is so that so,

828
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,655
for instance, reasoning and

829
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:42,695
query answering and machine

830
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:43,895
learning the other
services that

831
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,830
the platform provides can take

832
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,110
account of the definitions and

833
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,190
the schema information sort of

834
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,230
separately at the same time.

835
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,950
So yeah,

836
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,670
reasoning does work or is

837
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,670
integrated with
the schema multi

838
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,170
tenancy.

839
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:05,335
Great. Mark from Mark.

840
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:07,355
Does the SAP
connector all support

841
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:09,095
support document
retrieval like

842
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:12,315
fetching an invoice
and PDF format?

843
00:27:13,335 --> 00:27:16,150
Yeah. Thank you. Hi mark.

844
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,550
the sap connector as presently

845
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,250
constituted searches the what

846
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,170
we call maybe the metadata of

847
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,210
the of the back end.

848
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,710
It is not yet able
to do document

849
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:32,365
retrieval, although that's

850
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:33,565
something we've
been taking a look

851
00:27:33,565 --> 00:27:35,005
at as you may or
may not know,

852
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:37,645
StarDog includes
a subsystem we

853
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:40,045
call bites which
is the NLP and

854
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:43,185
document storage
layer of the system,

855
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,140
which allows us to
store documents

856
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,320
index index them
for later query

857
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,760
within the system.

858
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,580
those documents can be stored

859
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,740
in HDFS and s three and a few

860
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,500
other places. And,

861
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,020
one of the things
we're looking

862
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,895
at in the future is being able

863
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,595
to pull documents out of SAP

864
00:28:00,735 --> 00:28:02,595
into the local
Stardock store.

865
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:05,855
not not that's not working,

866
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:07,395
or we haven't added
that capability

867
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:08,115
just yet.

868
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:14,390
Great. Another one
from Olivier.

869
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,430
With regard to tech search,

870
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,130
do you rely upon
the underlying

871
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,710
tech search
facilities or do you

872
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,330
have your own index in stack?

873
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,130
hello again, Olivier.

874
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,990
if a combination
of those two are,

875
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,690
the the search capabilities

876
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,885
inside of Startog are based on

877
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:33,805
a at this point pretty heavily

878
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,585
modified version of lucine.

879
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:39,325
So we we we use
lucine and then

880
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,725
we have built up over the last

881
00:28:41,725 --> 00:28:44,350
few years of I
wouldn't say a fork,

882
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,550
but a a heavily
customized leucine

883
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,170
layer and that provides the,

884
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,090
the smart the the search
capabilities.

885
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,270
we're we're also
we we have a road

886
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,630
map item for second half of

887
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,525
twenty twenty one to move more

888
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:00,905
in an elastic search,

889
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,705
sort of
distributed architecture

890
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:04,165
for that.

891
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,485
But presently,
it's a it's a kind

892
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:08,265
of modified version
of BlueCeam.

893
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,600
Great. And from Veronica,

894
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,560
thank you for great talk.

895
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,620
You mentioned scalability.

896
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,080
What are the limitations of

897
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,780
Stardock around scalability?

898
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,780
good question. Hi, Veronica.

899
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:28,695
Well, it's it's
a bit dependent

900
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,515
on what features
of the system.

901
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:32,515
You mean
the the machine learning

902
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:34,035
and the text search
and the query

903
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:35,555
answering all scales sort of

904
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,255
differently, but let's just

905
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:38,675
restrict ourselves to query

906
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,490
answering one of the things I

907
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,850
wanted to do and
we'll talk and

908
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,210
and we've we've a bit run out

909
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,890
of time is we'll be releasing

910
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,410
some benchmarking in the in

911
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,250
the new year. I
wanted to announce

912
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,530
that here I'll
I'll just softly

913
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,630
mention it in the Q and a.

914
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,615
We have been testing
single node,

915
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:58,375
StarDog query,

916
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:01,635
Sparkle query answering
to the hundred

917
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,735
and fifty billion
triple layer,

918
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,175
level recently,

919
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,700
which is a a a a pretty big

920
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,680
expansion of of where
we are presently.

921
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,840
So I expect you
all to see that

922
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
available, and we do monthly

923
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,040
releases sometime in the first

924
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,340
quarter of this next year.

925
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:23,885
And then as I said,

926
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:25,245
there's lots of other aspects

927
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:25,905
of scalability.

928
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,745
Happy to answer
a a follow-up.

929
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:31,265
Grace.

930
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,060
Jean from Jean,

931
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,580
what is the best
way to integrate

932
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,700
data using virtualization like

933
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,940
Denodo or by exposing data in

934
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,960
open data format like RDF?

935
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,620
In the latter case,

936
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,235
it imposes to set up sparkle

937
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,975
access point for
each data source.

938
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:54,055
Correct? Question mark. yes.

939
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,975
that's one way to
do it in the latter

940
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:58,395
case in your in your
a b disjunct there.

941
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:00,135
there's, you know,

942
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,995
alternative in
the b case where

943
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,710
start out also
includes a native

944
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,630
ETL capability that's actually

945
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,230
powered by the same
mappings and

946
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,270
modeling that powers our

947
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,490
virtualization capability.

948
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,270
So you can always
ETL data into

949
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,950
the platform if that's what's

950
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,250
sort of required operationally

951
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,795
but I think the other thing I

952
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,095
wanna say is
our virtualization

953
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:22,315
capability and
the way it the way

954
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:25,755
it works is it it treats other

955
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:27,755
data sources as
if they were in

956
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,335
this open data
format like RDF,

957
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,810
and that and
that's what I mean

958
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,410
by talking about
connecting data

959
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,770
at the compute
layer rather than

960
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,910
at the storage layer.

961
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,370
So, Denodo, which is a a very

962
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,030
fine relational
probably the leading

963
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,790
relational
virtualization platform

964
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:46,645
does all of this at
the storage layer,

965
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:49,885
in terms of of
SQL as they have

966
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:50,805
a different model.

967
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:54,385
And and and that
means that SQL

968
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,765
or relational
based virtualization

969
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,745
inherits the limitations of

970
00:31:57,745 --> 00:31:59,090
the relational data model.

971
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,790
So when I said in my talk that

972
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,770
connecting data in the widest

973
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,210
scale of the enterprise
is a graph

974
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,890
problem, it's really a graph

975
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,770
data model problem,

976
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,450
which is really say
it's not a relational

977
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,670
data model problem.

978
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,290
so in some sense,
that distinction,

979
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,430
you know, using virtualization

980
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,815
or using an open data
format like RDF,

981
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:17,555
what startup is
doing is making

982
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:19,575
those really to be
the same thing.

983
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:23,095
Thanks, Kendall.

984
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:26,435
also from Veronica,
second question.

985
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:28,055
You mentioned
Shackle support.

986
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,820
Do you full shackle
supports as

987
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,660
described in the w three c

988
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,060
recommendation?

989
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,260
yes. We do. I I
there may be a few

990
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,620
tiny bit of pieces,

991
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,380
in core cases of the spec that

992
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,280
we don't support,

993
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:44,785
but it is substantially
full support.

994
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:46,785
I can't help but
point out that

995
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,165
star dog integrity constraint

996
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:51,085
validation system,

997
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:52,525
which shipped for
the first time

998
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:54,525
in twenty eleven,

999
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,930
I believe predated the shackle

1000
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,970
standards work by
many years and

1001
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,050
after supporting
in the marketplace

1002
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,870
commercially start
off integrity

1003
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,770
constraint validation,

1004
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,750
which used Allison tax rather

1005
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,690
than RDF and taxes
and shackle.

1006
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:11,055
We recently
announced deprecation

1007
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,455
of ICB and we're
sort of all in

1008
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:14,735
on shackle because the market

1009
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:15,855
has spoken and
the market wants

1010
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,455
to use shackle and
and that's fine.

1011
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,295
So we're really
proud of the work

1012
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:22,655
we did to pioneer
data validation

1013
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,880
in the RF world and again,

1014
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
II think there
may be a few very

1015
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,600
tiny cases as you
probably know

1016
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,680
Veronica specifications can be

1017
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,360
quite complex
things with often

1018
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,060
times requirements
or capabilities

1019
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,365
that are that are
that have a sort

1020
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,865
of smaller commercial impact.

1021
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:43,685
So I believe our
shackle support

1022
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:45,065
is substantially complete.

1023
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:51,545
Thanks Kendall.

1024
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,250
so, Ellie, question.

1025
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,990
What kinds of
applications would

1026
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,410
the start up team be
delighted to see?

1027
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,390
Oh, well, I mean,
strictly speaking,

1028
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,405
very big ones that are in

1029
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:09,185
production and
and strategically

1030
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:11,025
essential to large
enterprises.

1031
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:13,265
That's our that's our thing.

1032
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,785
I can say a little bit
less facetiously.

1033
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:23,130
I think Applications
so II think

1034
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,570
our first start on
cloud customer,

1035
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,690
which I'm not
quite ready to be

1036
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,690
able to talk about
will will be

1037
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,510
pulling together over several

1038
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,170
different cloud and on prem

1039
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,175
environments, one of the IT

1040
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:36,015
world's largest supply chains

1041
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:37,715
with respect to resellers

1042
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,555
customers product information

1043
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:42,735
support so that
they're thinking

1044
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,790
about this as
their product and

1045
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,270
channel graph,
product and channel

1046
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,090
knowledge graph.

1047
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,830
And this is a real
a very large,

1048
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,990
technology company, you know,

1049
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,550
a real stalwart of
the of the Fortune

1050
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,290
five hundred.

1051
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:01,505
And it'll be
a great example of

1052
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:03,965
this thesis that we have that

1053
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:08,445
the hybrid multi
cloud development

1054
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,045
is really making
the data problem

1055
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,300
harder, which means we need to

1056
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,480
be more thoughtful
and intentional

1057
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,220
about data management systems

1058
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,900
that address that kind of

1059
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,040
complexity and diversity.

1060
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,820
So, any new customers
are great,

1061
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,100
but I suspect we would be

1062
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,445
especially happy to see ones

1063
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:29,085
that are using our
capabilities to,

1064
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:32,285
connect data across
hybrid multi

1065
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:33,665
cloud data assets.

1066
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:38,045
Great. And then one minute,

1067
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:40,945
one more question.
and I do yeah.

1068
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:42,420
We'll reiterate the Slack.

1069
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,660
Will will continue
after this.

1070
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,340
From Jean, for good
data governance,

1071
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,740
is it advisable that very IT

1072
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,560
every IT project
provides an application

1073
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,520
data model?

1074
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,740
UML is better than nothing,

1075
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,220
but not inter interpretable by

1076
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,575
a machine. Is it realistic to

1077
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,355
request an owl instead,

1078
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,035
which requires new
competencies,

1079
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:04,875
which are not well
known presently?

1080
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:08,375
well, I for Jean,

1081
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,895
I appreciate the very simple

1082
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:11,355
question here at the end.

1083
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:13,195
that that one's a doozy.

1084
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,750
let me just try
to take a crack

1085
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,150
at it by saying that
there's a couple

1086
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,230
options. I don't
know that an owl

1087
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,210
model for every
application is required,

1088
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,590
certainly not
a deno like a new

1089
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,505
owl model Often
what's required

1090
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:30,005
is the subset of
the applications

1091
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:31,905
data model that
should be exposed

1092
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,485
publicly, can be
exposed publicly

1093
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,705
with lightweight RDF schema or

1094
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:37,905
with a little bit of hour or

1095
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,425
with no hours. So that's often

1096
00:36:39,425 --> 00:36:42,000
sufficient. I'll
also point out

1097
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
that there is a lot
of work, I think,

1098
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,080
supported by the o
g and a variety

1099
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,680
of vendors who were probably

1100
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,360
part of this community or at

1101
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,400
this conference
to make a subset

1102
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,940
of UML semantics
in UML diagrams

1103
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:58,455
machine interpreter will by

1104
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:01,515
giving
an algorithmic translation

1105
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:03,015
to owl to subsets of owl.

1106
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:05,735
So all is not
lost with respect

1107
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,515
to Uml and machine
interpretability.

1108
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:09,735
That's that's you
know only for

1109
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:13,170
some a subclass of of
all uml diagrams.

1110
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,830
So I don't think
for instance,

1111
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,970
the sequence and interaction

1112
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,250
diagrams count there,

1113
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,910
but the sort of
uml diagram you

1114
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,210
use for a data model,

1115
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,150
may well be
interpretable by my

1116
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,330
machine by being
translated to a so,

1117
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:27,205
I'd encourage you to look into

1118
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,585
that if if you have it.
