1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,700
Well, hello again, everyone.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,875
And, hopefully you managed to

3
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:09,975
find your way in.

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,575
Hope we didn't
keep you waiting

5
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:12,315
too long.

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,675
It's a pleasure today to be

7
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:16,800
introducing in,

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,800
knowledge connection
twenty twenty,

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,440
someone I know for,
well, over a decade,

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,880
I guess. We have,

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,640
the pleasure of
having, Mihir,

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,305
with us today from, Spinken.

13
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:28,805
And Michiel and I,

14
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:31,605
actually were
colleagues for a brief

15
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,805
while, back in Amsterdam,
like I said,

16
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,390
over over ten years ago.

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,490
We were both in related areas

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,170
in knowledge graph,

19
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,610
what today actually is called

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,170
knowledge graph.

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,690
Back then, it wasn't
called that,

22
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,915
but you know, same
same difference.

23
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,995
The topic was still the same.

24
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:52,395
His was more on
the visualization

25
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:55,150
and UI UX side,

26
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,250
and I guess he's
he's kept to that.

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,390
And this is what he's here to

28
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,570
talk about today as well.

29
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,945
So I'll get out of the way and

30
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,065
let me hear it.

31
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,305
The only thing to
mention to you,

32
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:09,885
if you want to
share anything,

33
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:10,525
like questions,

34
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,330
comments or anything else,

35
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,850
by now I guess you
know the process,

36
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,370
this little chat box.

37
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,050
I'll keep an eye on it and in

38
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,110
the end of the presentation

39
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,850
address your questions and

40
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,810
comments to be here.

41
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,015
So the floor is
yours. Thank you.

42
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:27,415
Welcome, everybody.

43
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:30,010
Nice to be here
and nice to see

44
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,910
some familiar people
in the participants

45
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,850
, list. Alright.

46
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,870
Can you put on my
my screen share?

47
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:41,505
I should pause that and then

48
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:44,245
quickly switch to this one.

49
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:46,625
You should be able to
see my slides now.

50
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,710
Right? So let's put
it in full screen.

51
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,430
So for Fog Worldwide,

52
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,250
I'm going to talk
about so this

53
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,570
is a project you
have been working

54
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,575
on the last months.

55
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:02,095
I work for a company
called Spink.

56
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,515
You see the logo
here at the bottom

57
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,630
left. We are actually
in the business

58
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,870
of creating search
solutions for

59
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,850
for knowledge graphs.

60
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,070
And we're gonna have a look at

61
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,325
how we apply that
here for this

62
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,465
project for worldwide.

63
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,565
So before I say
anything else,

64
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,620
I should really give credit to

65
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,140
the organizations
and the people

66
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,680
that were involved
in this project.

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,940
So here at the top,

68
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,700
you see three
cultural heritage

69
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,800
organizations in
the Netherlands.

70
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:30,995
The one on the right,

71
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,615
you're probably
familiar with.

72
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,155
And here at the bottom,

73
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,240
you see some other companies,

74
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,460
more technology companies,

75
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,440
design companies involved in

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,780
this project. And I myself,

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,940
as I said here, at SPYNC.

78
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,905
So there's three things that I

79
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:50,345
would like to do
with you today

80
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:51,945
in this talk. Of course,

81
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,305
we're gonna have a look at for

82
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:54,620
a whole wide and,

83
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,160
why are we doing
this and how.

84
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,460
Next, I want to make a,

85
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,620
a claim for cultural heritage

86
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,065
organizations to
connect their data.

87
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,205
And finally, we're gonna have

88
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:10,565
a look at how we
employ the concept

89
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,280
of search design to access

90
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,320
knowledge graphs.

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,600
So let's start with Vincent.

92
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,940
So physics for
growth really is

93
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,085
a worldwide
phenomenon by now.

94
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,185
So this is a visualization of

95
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:26,925
his artworks where they are

96
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:27,905
currently located.

97
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,810
And as you you
might wonder what

98
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,170
what is here in
the Pacific Ocean?

99
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,470
Well, this is
actually Honolulu

100
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,210
in in Hawaii. Right?

101
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,545
So it's really
spread out to all

102
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:40,445
continents all
the way to Sydney,

103
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:45,545
Australia. And what we do in

104
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,370
projects like this is that we

105
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,790
usually start
from the end user

106
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,810
perspective. So
what are the search

107
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,705
tasks that people
are having for

108
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:57,765
this type of data.

109
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,165
Now you see here a picture,

110
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:01,765
a little bit empty,

111
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,720
as you probably can expect.

112
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,080
During this presentation,

113
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,560
we'll start filling
the rest of

114
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,960
this picture.
But we start here

115
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,955
from the right side.

116
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,215
So what are the users here?

117
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,395
Well, in this case,

118
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,235
these are really
professional users.

119
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,375
So these are researchers,

120
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:21,420
in the art humanities domain.

121
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,740
And you have
a couple of examples

122
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
of research questions that,

123
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,555
that they have from
actual people.

124
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:31,875
For example,

125
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:34,995
Verhoeff painted
several artworks

126
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,475
from the family
Houlain in France.

127
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,570
So which members of the family

128
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,790
did he actually paint?

129
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,530
A much more
complicated question

130
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,905
is this one. So,

131
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,145
for several artworks
of van Gogh,

132
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:49,905
it's not exactly
known when they

133
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,745
were painted. And
sometimes also

134
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,185
the order of in which they are

135
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:54,465
painted was this one before

136
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:55,770
the other one is not known.

137
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,730
And finding this out
is a big topic.

138
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,490
And they use a lot
of information

139
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,910
from that. From this range is

140
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,625
really from analyzing
the paint,

141
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,125
the actual material
to the canvas,

142
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,025
that it was was used for.

143
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,305
For example, it's
two paintings

144
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:11,465
use canvas from
the same role.

145
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,300
This is, of course,

146
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,503
an indication that they were

147
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,720
created close by in time.

148
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,320
Another picture,

149
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,035
another question is
actually, I think,

150
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:23,135
for someone else
attending now,

151
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,690
is more sort of
a social aspect,

152
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,050
right? So how are
the paintings

153
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,650
of a book perceived
throughout time,

154
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,510
right? They are exhibited for

155
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,030
more than a century.

156
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,625
And how were they perceived?

157
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,065
How were they
exposed together?

158
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,905
How was it how
did people write

159
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,945
about those paintings?

160
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:41,565
And how did that
change throughout

161
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:44,260
the decennial? All right.

162
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,360
So that should have given you

163
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,000
an idea what we're
trying to do here.

164
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,960
So let's just go there.

165
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:55,885
So you should see
now, the website,

166
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:58,685
and, let's try to start with

167
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,065
the the simple
question that you

168
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:02,990
just saw. Let's search for,

169
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,070
Now what you see here is six

170
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,370
paintings made by.

171
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:10,565
The first thing that I have to

172
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:11,925
say is that these are actually

173
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,265
not all the paintings
by this family.

174
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:15,705
Because at the moment,

175
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:18,220
we have collected
all the paintings,

176
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,200
or all artworks,
I should say,

177
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,260
in in the Netherlands,

178
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,420
from a dozen institutions.

179
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,480
The second phase is,

180
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,020
is currently starting.

181
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,725
And in this phase,

182
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,425
we're going to collect
all the information

183
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,025
from the other institutions.

184
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,225
But already plenty
to see here.

185
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,150
But of course, this is not so

186
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,030
spectacular yet.

187
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,730
I mean, this you can also see

188
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,530
see on Wikipedia.

189
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,235
So let's dive into it
a little bit more.

190
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:44,435
So for example, this,

191
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:48,035
this cute little boy, again,

192
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:49,555
becomes more
interesting because

193
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:50,915
already here on
the right side,

194
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,910
you see images
and becomes even

195
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,390
more interesting
if I open this

196
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,350
because these are actually

197
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,650
available in high resolution.

198
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,450
So this means I
can can zoom in

199
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,015
and and look at
these boys' eyes.

200
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,755
And this becomes even more

201
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:07,435
interesting if I start looking

202
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:11,930
at more technical
recordings of,

203
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,050
of this painting.

204
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,570
So this is what is
called breaking

205
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,570
light, where
the light is shared

206
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,110
on the painting
from the side.

207
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,035
And this really gives a good

208
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:22,915
view on how Vergoc used his

209
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:25,555
paint to to get all
kinds of effects,

210
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:26,995
right, the thickness of the of

211
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:27,850
the paint here.

212
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,010
Another thing that's very

213
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,270
interesting is
this canvas is,

214
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,270
of course, stretched
on a frame.

215
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,490
And this frame contains all

216
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,235
kinds of information. Right?

217
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:40,475
So there are are
label stickers

218
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:43,275
on it that indicated who has

219
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:46,050
owned this painting
and, where it was,

220
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,190
for example, exhibited.

221
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,650
So here is actually one from

222
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,750
nineteen twenty eight
from an exhibition

223
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,110
in Germany.

224
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,535
Later in time, I guess they

225
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:57,895
wanted to protect
this frame and

226
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,235
they added a cover
on top of it,

227
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,550
which when you borrow
the the painting,

228
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,590
you're not allowed
to take off.

229
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,930
So the more recent exhibitions

230
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,790
actually have their,

231
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,630
their stickers here on the on

232
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,435
on this back panel.

233
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,675
Okay, so let's close this high

234
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:16,235
resolution few and
scroll down a bit.

235
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:17,675
Of course, there is object

236
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:20,110
metadata about the artwork.

237
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,650
But there's also
various other things.

238
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,370
For example,

239
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,850
van Gogh has written a lot of

240
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,610
letters to mainly
to his brother,

241
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,305
but also some to
some colleagues.

242
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:30,485
In his letters,

243
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,165
he he often mentions
his artwork.

244
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,645
So the same for
for this artwork.

245
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:35,865
So you can read about,

246
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,010
what he said about that.

247
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,750
Who has previously
owned these artworks,

248
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,050
going from his brother to,

249
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,830
to where it's
currently located.

250
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:46,225
And here we see those,

251
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:47,345
those exhibitions.

252
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:48,705
So what we saw there,

253
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:50,165
the sticker at
the background,

254
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:52,305
on the on the frame
in nineteen

255
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:53,960
twenty eight is actually this

256
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,840
exhibition. So we
can click this

257
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,680
exhibition and now see which

258
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,220
other artworks were
also exposed there.

259
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,635
And so that gives you,

260
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,415
a completely different
perspective,

261
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:07,775
on the artworks.

262
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,355
Now there are various other

263
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:10,315
things that you can,

264
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:11,935
can explore yourself,

265
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,290
after this presentation.

266
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,210
So let's get back,
to the presentation.

267
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:21,285
So what we've done now,

268
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,445
we've we've seen sort
of the user side.

269
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:25,125
So what's happening
in the background?

270
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,405
Of course, there's
all kinds of

271
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:29,090
data coming from,
from institutions,

272
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,650
and somehow we want to create

273
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,890
a knowledge graph
out of this.

274
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,725
Now I want to
approach this part

275
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:40,005
of the talk from a sort of

276
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,845
personal insight that I gained

277
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:42,905
during this project.

278
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,410
I've been working
in in Credoheads

279
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,630
already for, for about fifteen

280
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,095
years coming from
this technical

281
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:53,555
perspective. But
what I realized

282
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,635
in this project is that there

283
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:57,475
really is a wealth
of knowledge

284
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,650
in these this organization.

285
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,350
So you can truly call them

286
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,470
knowledge institutes.

287
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,045
But what surprised me is that

288
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,725
only a small part of this

289
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,825
knowledge is actually
available online.

290
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,525
So, of course,
these numbers are

291
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,970
speculative that I
that I present here.

292
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,650
And this will not be
the same for all.

293
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,350
For some, this will
be a lot more.

294
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,210
But in general,

295
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,490
there's really a lot of stuff

296
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,510
that is not available
online yet.

297
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,205
What we managed to do with is

298
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,265
to increase this.

299
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:26,925
And so, for example,

300
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,285
these exhibitions
that I showed

301
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,425
you in the high address,

302
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,970
photos are now
made available.

303
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,890
So in that sense,

304
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,710
FOCO worldwide has has helped

305
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,630
to reach the full
potential for

306
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,995
for cultural organizations.

307
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,515
But what I truly
believe is that,

308
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,095
for the cultural heritage

309
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,215
organizations themselves,

310
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,060
there is so much potential to

311
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,080
gain if they start to,

312
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,720
organize themselves around

313
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,760
connected data.

314
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,820
So not only just
for sharing it

315
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,800
to other portals,

316
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,845
but also for
themselves because

317
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:01,445
it will empower them to do so

318
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:03,465
many more things and truly be

319
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:07,140
a a knowledge
institute on the web.

320
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,280
So, that's almost,

321
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,780
almost a call out to these

322
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,160
organizations. So how should

323
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,220
they do this then?

324
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,065
Well, this should start with

325
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:19,265
within their organization.

326
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,485
And so there's not just this

327
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:22,765
collection management system

328
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,065
from which you
see a screenshot

329
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,730
here on the left
with this typical

330
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,550
object metadata.

331
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,810
That was actually
the stuff that

332
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,190
I have known for years.

333
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,450
But there is so much more.

334
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,810
And so you have already seen

335
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,870
some of those assets.

336
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:35,075
And some of the things
you haven't

337
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,575
seen is also x
rays or infrared

338
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:40,275
photography. There's
really a wealth

339
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,495
of information there.

340
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,860
Then there was
documents, literature,

341
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,860
research reports,
publications,

342
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,880
all discussing and providing

343
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,180
interesting perspectives.

344
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,315
So the organization
should really

345
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,475
organize this and
start connecting

346
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:56,915
this data.

347
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,930
Secondly, they should connect

348
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,230
to external authorities.

349
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,870
And there is a lot of
knowledge inside,

350
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,665
but outside, there
is a lot that

351
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:08,805
can complement this.

352
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,225
And here you see a couple of

353
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,385
examples for people
in the cultural

354
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:13,285
heritage domain,

355
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,620
probably familiar
with something

356
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,160
known as the art
and architecture

357
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,620
or in short, AT.

358
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,800
This provides very
rich information,

359
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,240
for example, about materials,

360
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,795
type of paintings, etcetera.

361
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,995
Of course, literature,
for example,

362
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,515
as as modeled in Fiaf.

363
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,930
And in the Netherlands,

364
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,810
is a very interesting source

365
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,370
collecting information
about artists,

366
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,065
museums, owners,
etcetera. Right?

367
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:43,165
So all this
information provides

368
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,170
a way of integrating data and

369
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,630
at the same time providing

370
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,630
additional backgrounds
information.

371
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,050
Okay, so given
these two things,

372
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,830
connecting inside
and connecting,

373
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,865
adding external information to

374
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:00,445
the inside. How to do that?

375
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,385
Well, very good
news that since,

376
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
since a while now,

377
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
there is a community effort in

378
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,140
this domain, on
a shared data model.

379
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,795
And they call
this linked art.

380
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,795
And this is a very
nice initiative

381
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,995
because what it does,

382
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,975
it really tries to
find a sweet spot,

383
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,435
on top of a very
expressive model,

384
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,870
which is called CDOS AM,

385
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,110
but which is maybe
a bit complicated

386
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,090
to use. And what
LinkedAR managed

387
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,010
to do is really
reach the sweet

388
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,690
spot that made it possible for

389
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,255
organizations to
start using to

390
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:34,935
start express all this which

391
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,375
which information
that they have.

392
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,535
And, now here you see
a snippet of that.

393
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:39,735
Of course, we're not go gonna

394
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,715
go into detail.

395
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,520
But I do wanna
point out a couple

396
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,160
of things here.

397
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,140
So for example,

398
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,840
the reference to an AT concept

399
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,900
here and the reference
to a place.

400
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,865
And And also interesting here

401
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,805
is the modeling of dates,

402
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,305
which actually allows you to

403
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:57,485
model vagueness in dates.

404
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,850
So that brings me to the last

405
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,350
one is that
the quality of data

406
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,805
is really a big thing.

407
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,885
So a lot of time during this

408
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:09,405
project was actually spent by

409
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,165
the data owners in improving

410
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,165
their quality. And
so in the collection

411
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,785
management systems,
they often,

412
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,760
for example, use not
complete dates.

413
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,840
And this this is
the case because

414
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,705
they don't they
don't know the exact

415
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,485
exact date. It's
either in a period

416
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,225
that is made or
they don't know

417
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,085
exactly when it
started or ended.

418
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,805
And by allowing
them to actually,

419
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,245
model this fakeness,

420
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,370
we can then start doing things

421
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,570
like sorting updates,

422
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,010
which is of course
not possible

423
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,870
if you don't have
a well formed date.

424
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,050
But there are various other

425
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,435
issues in data
quality as well.

426
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,715
Now what we notice
in this project is,

427
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:50,235
expressed here by
this, by this quote.

428
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:52,680
So you can read it yourself.

429
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,460
So what really
happened is that

430
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,705
once they saw information,

431
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:01,785
their information
being used on

432
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,265
the web and seeing, hey.

433
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,880
This is actually complete or

434
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
this is wrong. That really was

435
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,660
a big incentive to
start improving

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,300
the data.

437
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:15,455
One of the examples,

438
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,815
if you then have good data,

439
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,515
you have it connected
to external

440
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,775
authorities. For example,

441
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:20,895
here in for wide,

442
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:22,415
you see these these filters on

443
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,760
on the left side that you're

444
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,600
obviously familiar
with from all

445
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,140
kinds of search applications.

446
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,160
Now here, this
gives a very nice

447
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
overview of
the high level what

448
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,735
kind of different
types of objects

449
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,915
there are. If you've seen any

450
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,115
website that aggregates,

451
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:40,815
especially culture data from

452
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:41,535
different sources,

453
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:43,155
usually these
things are a mess,

454
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,690
Right? So what we do here,

455
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,770
we use controls
for gamblers for

456
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,130
all of that. Meaning also that

457
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,170
if you don't use them,

458
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,670
you will not end up
in these filters.

459
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:53,775
But we provide some sort of

460
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:56,095
flexibility because
although we

461
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:57,855
show these high level
categories here,

462
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,295
which was one of the wishes of

463
00:15:59,295 --> 00:15:59,955
the users,

464
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,450
We allow also institutions to

465
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,370
provide many more
specific things.

466
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,450
But by using the relations in

467
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,190
this thesaurus,

468
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,395
we can then provide the level

469
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,255
that we need here
in the interface.

470
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,635
So we use
the background knowledge

471
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:17,935
for that. All right.

472
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's come back
to this picture.

473
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,760
So we've seen now,

474
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,560
coming from the right side,

475
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,995
that we start to understand

476
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,015
the search tasks that
are involved here.

477
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:31,495
We have seen how organizations

478
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,095
can capture their knowledge,

479
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,435
and they've
actually been doing

480
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,380
that themselves. Right?

481
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,900
So this is not that we start

482
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,660
harvesting their
data and do this.

483
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,780
They actually have been doing

484
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,420
this themselves,

485
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,600
which was really cool for us.

486
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:44,785
But clearly in this picture,

487
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,465
there's there's a gap
in the middle.

488
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,905
Right? So how are we going to

489
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:50,325
solve the search task using

490
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,765
using this knowledge graph?

491
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,410
That brings me to this part.

492
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,030
And, we obviously,

493
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,550
we need some sort
of API, right,

494
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,690
that goes to the website.

495
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,495
And but what
happens before that

496
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:04,755
is what we call
relevance models.

497
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:06,495
And I'll explain to you why we

498
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:07,875
call it relevance models.

499
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,310
Because what it has to do with

500
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,470
for us is actually three type

501
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,470
of queries. And if
you're familiar

502
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,230
with with graph data,

503
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,975
you're familiar with
the first Right?

504
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,075
So structured graph queries,

505
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:22,315
for example, give me
all the artworks,

506
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,855
and and sort them by
by the production

507
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:28,000
date. Now that's a very
valid question.

508
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,540
But in applications
like this,

509
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,900
there's usually a full text

510
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,020
component as well.

511
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,545
So what about
the documents that

512
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:36,845
mentioned for folks health?

513
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:39,245
And in fact, in most cases,

514
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,985
they combine these
things, right?

515
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,745
So there is structured and

516
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,925
unstructured
information combined,

517
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,410
right? So in particular,

518
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,090
this unstructured part,

519
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,330
we're starting to
deal with relevance,

520
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,370
right, aboutness.

521
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,290
It's not just true or false.

522
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,145
And what I like to show you is

523
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,205
how we solve these
things in SpeedDesk.

524
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:01,140
So what we're trying to do is

525
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,220
to really allow
people to create

526
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,000
these relevance
models themselves.

527
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,420
So what you should
see now is,

528
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,845
is being desk, which should be

529
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,045
run as a as a cloud service.

530
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:13,965
And, here,

531
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:16,865
the the full API of
the of the application

532
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
is, shown here.

533
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,900
This is basically
the whole API,

534
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,580
of the application.

535
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,105
And for each endpoint,

536
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,405
they are implemented
as what we

537
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,885
call strategies or
in other words,

538
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:31,945
relevance models.

539
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,010
And what I want to do with you

540
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,550
is to actually create one.

541
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,770
Not exactly what
we use in these

542
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,810
applications, but just to

543
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,350
illustrate how we do that.

544
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:42,665
And we do that in a visual

545
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:45,225
programming interface.

546
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:47,525
So here on the left side,

547
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,705
we have a library of
building blocks.

548
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,040
And what we can do is we can

549
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,980
drag those blocks
onto the convos,

550
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,140
and there we can
start creating

551
00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,265
relevance models.

552
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:01,005
So to start with,

553
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,605
I'm just gonna
take all the data

554
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:03,725
that we have. So basically you

555
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,245
can say this is
this is the graph

556
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,270
that we have. And what I want

557
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,030
to do here is I want
to make a search

558
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,950
engine for all
the letters that

559
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,270
Verkhof wrote.
So I'm not gonna

560
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,070
take all the data,

561
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,225
but actually dragged
in another block.

562
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,945
And I'm going to
filter my data

563
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,725
on messages. So as
you notice here,

564
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,585
these are modeled
with schema dot org.

565
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,520
So I select the messages.

566
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,060
Now I can inspect the output

567
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,120
here of this block.

568
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,260
And we see here on the right

569
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,675
side information.

570
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,595
Let me increase
this a little bit.

571
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:37,915
So here are,
the number of letters.

572
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:38,955
Now this is not a lot.

573
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:40,655
This is nine hundred three.

574
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
But let's let's
create a search

575
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,160
engine for this.

576
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,020
For example, we're
using the text

577
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,700
of those letters.

578
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:50,745
So what I can do
is I can actually

579
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:51,885
extract this text.

580
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,090
There we go.

581
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,110
And I configured
this to actually

582
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,010
take the text that
we want to use.

583
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:06,415
And now we can say,

584
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,175
let's build a document search

585
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:08,895
engine for this.

586
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:11,715
So this is a particular
relevance model.

587
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,330
And in fact, this is actually

588
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,670
the model that is
used by by most,

589
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,890
off the shelf search engine

590
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,125
systems like Solr,
Elasticsearch.

591
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:23,265
So, basically,
what we're doing,

592
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,025
we're building that
here on the spot.

593
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,765
So we just miss one
component here,

594
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:28,885
namely the input,

595
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,620
And let's say for now that we

596
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,760
want to search for
mental health.

597
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,095
Maybe we configure our search

598
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:41,455
engine a bit. I
know that we're

599
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,895
talking about English here,

600
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,595
so let's apply some stemming.

601
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,160
And now the magic
happens because

602
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
when I start inspecting
the outputs,

603
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
what the system
does for you is

604
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,680
actually create
the indexes that

605
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,185
are required. Right?

606
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:55,465
So and in this way,

607
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:56,985
you as a user don't need to

608
00:20:56,985 --> 00:21:00,205
think about what are
the the technical

609
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,705
aspects that I
need to realize,

610
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:03,485
what kind of index do I need.

611
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,800
But you can think at a much

612
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,160
higher abstraction level,

613
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,680
what should my relevance model

614
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,580
actually look like.

615
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
And what you see now that we

616
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,020
actually find all
kinds of results,

617
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,725
and these are
ranked as you can

618
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:15,105
see here in this probability

619
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,565
distribution. And
at the beginning

620
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:18,465
we see here,

621
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,710
maybe we're not maybe we're

622
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,550
actually not gonna
expect these results,

623
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,870
but what if we start
analyzing them?

624
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,290
So we go sort of
back to our graph.

625
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,085
And let's say now
we're interested

626
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:34,145
in which periods these letters

627
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:36,350
were written. So I'm going to

628
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,270
extract actually the date that

629
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,250
they were sent.

630
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:43,825
There we go.

631
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:50,640
And here we are at eighteen

632
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
eighty nine and
eighteen eighty

633
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,000
eight is the most
relevant years.

634
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,975
Now it turns out that actually

635
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:00,195
cut off his ear,

636
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:02,595
in December eighty eight.

637
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,735
So it's not surprising that

638
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:05,615
around this time,

639
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,640
he was writing mostly about

640
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,940
about this mental health.

641
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,160
We can also do something
else and say,

642
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,025
hey, let's now
look to something

643
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:17,065
completely different.

644
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:18,445
So from those letters,

645
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:20,125
let's move to the artworks.

646
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:22,825
And the artworks that he has

647
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,205
mentioned in those letters.

648
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,000
So what are actually
the artworks

649
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,060
most involved in this whole

650
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,080
topic of mental
health health?

651
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,185
Now this is probably a bit

652
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,645
difficult to read for you.

653
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:37,045
On the website they're
nicely formatted.

654
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:39,445
But here you see that painting

655
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:40,885
of Madame Goulain,

656
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,480
which was actually painted at

657
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,860
the end of eighty eight.

658
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,420
And here's another painting of

659
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
of the sunflowers all sort of

660
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,565
in that that period.

661
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,005
Now I hope this
gave you an idea

662
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:52,285
how you can play
with these things,

663
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,805
create relevance models over

664
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,385
over both the text
and the structured

665
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:57,665
structured part.

666
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,520
If I am correct,
I have, like,

667
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,640
one minute left.

668
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,655
So let's briefly then look at

669
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:08,115
how we are doing this.

670
00:23:08,975 --> 00:23:11,935
So if you're sort of in the in

671
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:13,135
the knowledge graph domain,

672
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:14,255
you're you're
familiar with this

673
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:14,895
picture. Right?

674
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,210
So what we have
at the bottom,

675
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,750
oh, sorry. At the top,

676
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,350
the top of the iceberg is some

677
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,950
sort of API that is used by,

678
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,010
by an application.

679
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:25,835
Underneath that,

680
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,455
there is some sort of graph

681
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:30,455
database and and a graph
query language.

682
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:31,975
And what's what we find very

683
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,175
interesting is to look at what

684
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:35,080
are now the rules
that are needed

685
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,980
to solve these things. Right?

686
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,740
We need some
developer to create

687
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,360
these things. And
this is typically,

688
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,940
yeah, just below the surface,

689
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,240
just above the surface.

690
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:47,305
Now if you need
full tech support,

691
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,285
then typically
this is added on

692
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:50,025
the site.

693
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:53,510
And although there
are solutions here,

694
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,270
it's not very easy to combine

695
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,190
these things.
And what you need

696
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,310
of course is someone that now

697
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,010
has knowledge of
both these things.

698
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:01,985
So what we're trying to do,

699
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:03,845
we actually push
the technology

700
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,705
all the way down.

701
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,065
So at the lowest level,

702
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,585
we actually implemented these

703
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:08,965
things in one system,

704
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,340
which is a probabilistic
graph database.

705
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,920
On top of that,

706
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,000
we have
a probabilistic relation

707
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,280
to algebra that can deal with

708
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,755
these things. And if you're

709
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:18,555
interested in that,

710
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,055
you can read about
that in the literature

711
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,495
. Oh, sorry about that.

712
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:24,475
But most importantly for us is

713
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:26,075
that all of this is now under

714
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:28,490
the surface. But
above the surface,

715
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,890
we now have a way that we can

716
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,430
support
information specialists

717
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,805
to deal with
accessing knowledge

718
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,805
graphs and text
in the same same

719
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:38,885
way to create relevance models

720
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:40,825
that are needed for,
for an application.

721
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,340
And that is what I just just

722
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,780
showed to you.

723
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,080
So to wrap this up,

724
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,220
a lot of knowledge
potential in

725
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,440
corporates organizations.

726
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,225
But for that, they really need

727
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,265
to understand the users.

728
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:53,625
They need to capture their

729
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,725
knowledge and finally model

730
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,265
the relevance that
is needed for

731
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:58,925
the applications.

732
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,420
Great. Thanks.
Thanks, Miguel.

733
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
Well, great, great slides.

734
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,795
We have some some
questions from,

735
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,975
people, but, you know,

736
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:17,655
I'll seamlessly take advantage

737
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:18,870
of my position here,

738
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,550
and I'll I'll make
the the first

739
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,070
question because, well,

740
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,590
you you triggered my interest

741
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,630
with something you said.

742
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,550
So you mentioned you're using

743
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,635
a probabilistic
graph database.

744
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,935
I'm supposed to be the expert

745
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:31,915
on graph databases,

746
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:34,375
but I've never
heard about it.

747
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,335
Would you like to say, like,

748
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:37,050
a couple of words
of What it is?

749
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,530
Who built it? How
it works? Yeah.

750
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,870
So so the work
originated actually

751
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,305
in database or actually to be

752
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:46,145
more precise is the merger of

753
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,745
two fields,
relational databases

754
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:49,125
and information retrieval.

755
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:51,685
At the end of the 1990s,

756
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:53,285
work was done there.

757
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,610
And And basically
what it means

758
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,010
is adding a score column to,

759
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,710
to a triple or quadruple.

760
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,950
So we have lifted it
from the database

761
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,125
world to, to
the graph, world.

762
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:06,285
So, where we add scores.

763
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:08,505
And now what do you do with

764
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:10,240
these scores? The interesting

765
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
thing is that
the research that

766
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,960
I showed you there,

767
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,140
there are various
there is an algebra

768
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,805
to deal with these
scores. Right?

769
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:18,005
How how to combine them,

770
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:18,645
how to add them,

771
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,245
how to multiply them for for

772
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,145
different operations.

773
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:22,965
So at the lowest level,

774
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:24,905
there is actually
graph scores,

775
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,890
but more importantly
is at the top

776
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,810
level is then how you how you

777
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,830
use those scores for
certain operations.

778
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,495
Okay. Okay. Well, yeah,

779
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,015
you you provided
the reference,

780
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:35,835
and I guess,

781
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:38,375
I or anyone else
who's interested

782
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,655
will will have to look it up.

783
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:41,335
But, yeah, it's it's a very

784
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:42,455
interesting concept.

785
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:46,040
And, let's see
what people have

786
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,720
been asking. K.

787
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,835
Another question is,

788
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:53,195
which is very
specific I guess,

789
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,115
what is the rank
by text block?

790
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,555
And I get it's tied to one

791
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:59,200
specific slide you
had. Yeah, yeah.

792
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,280
So I use the rank by text or

793
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,100
more specifically,

794
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,500
I use the rank by
BN twenty five,

795
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:06,805
which is a relevance model.

796
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,005
And so so this is used by

797
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:09,545
Elasticsearch as well.

798
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,445
And, what it does,

799
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:14,090
it implements this
for for you.

800
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,770
Right? So the the actual query

801
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,630
that you need, is implemented

802
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,450
in that path. So basically,

803
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,610
you can grab whatever entities

804
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,725
you have in your
Knowledge Graph

805
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:25,225
and say, I need this text and

806
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,825
sort of throw it
in Elasticsearch

807
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,205
as you want. But
the nice thing

808
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:30,645
is you don't need to because

809
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:31,930
the system does it for you.

810
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,310
So we actually
create the indexes

811
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,210
that you need to create that

812
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,810
search engine. So it all runs

813
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,645
into the same system. Okay.

814
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:44,745
Well, like many
people are saying

815
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:46,345
in in the comments,
that sounds really,

816
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:47,485
really cool, actually.

817
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,490
Another question and
again from from me,

818
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,910
you mentioned that certain

819
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,630
vocabulary at some
point linked the art,

820
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,370
if I recall,

821
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:59,455
And you said it's
kind of good,

822
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,335
sweet spot, middle
ground, between,

823
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:05,215
different expressivity,
methods.

824
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,820
And you also mentioned that it

825
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,220
allows you it's
kind of it allows

826
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,820
to deal with vagueness and

827
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,755
specifically
vagueness in dates.

828
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:16,555
So would you like
to expand a little

829
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,235
bit on the expressivity
part and

830
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:19,755
then maybe
specifically on the on

831
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,820
the vagueness? Yeah. Yeah.

832
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,640
So what I specifically said is

833
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,400
that it finds the right sweet

834
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,320
spot between expressivity and

835
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,115
ease of use. And so you could

836
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:30,655
almost position it between,

837
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:31,995
schema dot org,

838
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:33,515
which is relatively
easy to use.

839
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:35,355
But for something rich and

840
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:36,715
heterogeneous as we needed it

841
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,410
for cohort wide,

842
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,270
it was it was
just not enough.

843
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,770
And at the other hand,

844
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,770
there is something
known as CDOC CRM,

845
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,210
which is an event
based model,

846
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,810
which allows you
to model a lot

847
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,825
of stuff. But,

848
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:49,385
to figure out how to use it is

849
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:50,185
a bit complicated.

850
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:52,345
So what Linked Art has done is

851
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:54,345
what they call
an application profile.

852
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:55,225
So under the hood,

853
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,810
they actually use
Cedarc Serum,

854
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,810
the user classes,
the user relations,

855
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,790
the actual stuff.

856
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,970
But they created
what they call

857
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,350
an application
profile in JSON LD.

858
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:06,245
So you can actually write it

859
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,825
down quite simple
in simple terms.

860
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,445
And this is
a community effort.

861
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,825
So it's full of
documentations,

862
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:15,240
the patterns that
you need come

863
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,000
from actual use
cases from actual

864
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,300
institutions. And,

865
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,160
we had we had some
discussion with them.

866
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,440
There were a couple of things

867
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,945
that that we needed and things

868
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,805
were changed. So this
is still ongoing,

869
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:28,025
but this really
suited our needs.

870
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:29,785
So if that would not have been

871
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,640
that this this would be quite

872
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
a quite a drama to to do.

873
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,360
So, so that that's
that sweet spot.

874
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,720
And the other question, yeah,

875
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,620
about the dates.

876
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,195
And so in this
domain, people say,

877
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:44,215
late late autumn,

878
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:47,495
eighteen eighty
eight or October

879
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,010
nineteen hundred.

880
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,090
And what it allows
you to do is

881
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,030
basically define
the vagueness,

882
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,290
of a period. So
there are things

883
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,150
like the begin of the begin,

884
00:29:58,615 --> 00:29:59,895
the end of the begin,

885
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:00,695
the beginning of the end,

886
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:01,735
and the end of the end.

887
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:03,815
And so you describe vagueness

888
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,735
of periods where the where but

889
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:07,915
you use actual excess dates.

890
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,090
So for a system,

891
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,090
you now have proper dates that

892
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,930
you can use. They might not be

893
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,290
the exact date, but
at least you can,

894
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,910
for example, sort
on something.

895
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,345
And typically this
is accompanied

896
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:21,945
then by textual description,

897
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:25,305
something like late
autumn eighty eight,

898
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,250
which you can display
in the interface.

899
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,550
So it sort of
gives you the best

900
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,970
of both worlds. Okay. Yeah.

901
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,990
I don't know. I mean,

902
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,215
both of those things
that you described,

903
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,135
well, the, the way that,

904
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:38,975
people have worked
with elite,

905
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,935
art vocabulary to me
sounds, you know,

906
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:42,890
exemplary, basically.

907
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,750
So making it easy for,

908
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,570
developers to use,

909
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,210
by by leveraging JSONRT and

910
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,570
doing these different profiles

911
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,390
that you mentioned.

912
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,695
And then on
the dates, this is,

913
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:54,735
like, a, you know,

914
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:56,735
notoriously difficult issue,

915
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,630
how to manage
overlapping dates

916
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,670
and even more back dates.

917
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,770
So if they manage to
to address that,

918
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,070
that's that's
super cool. Yeah.

919
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,670
Yeah. Of course,

920
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,510
they need to
create this data.

921
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,795
Right? And,

922
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,255
what you saw in
this project is

923
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:12,795
that
the the larger institutions

924
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:15,195
like the Hoch Museum,
the Rijksmuseum,

925
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,130
they were doing these
things themselves.

926
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,510
So they have their
own pipelines

927
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,270
for creative data mappings.

928
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,510
For smaller institutions,

929
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:24,335
we actually help
them with it.

930
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:26,335
I mean, smaller in
sense of for whole,

931
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:28,115
right? So people
providing like

932
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,510
ten artworks. So what I didn't

933
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,030
show you that in Spring Desk,

934
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,390
there is a part where you can

935
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,410
actually create those
mappings as well.

936
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,970
So we help them
with that part.

937
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:41,415
Okay. Let's see.

938
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:43,915
I think we may have
one last question.

939
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,235
I'm getting to actually show.

940
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:47,810
Says, technically,

941
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,650
using the SPYNC tool requires

942
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,310
to upload data
into a proprietary

943
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:53,190
database.

944
00:31:56,555 --> 00:31:58,635
Yes. I mean,
we're coming a bit

945
00:31:58,635 --> 00:32:00,235
from the search area.

946
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,415
So often we actually
call it an index.

947
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:05,070
Yeah. Right. So it's
sort of a layer

948
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,170
on top of your data.

949
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,270
So we're not the data
management system.

950
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,770
We interface or
we connect with

951
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,830
existing systems.

952
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,365
So, yeah, but that
is required.

953
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:17,965
So we're not doing
federated search.

954
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,565
That that that
that is clearly,

955
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,520
something different.
Okay. Yeah.

956
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,860
That's that's that's
clear. Alright.

957
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Well, thanks,
thanks once again,

958
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,200
to you, Michiel,

959
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,995
and to everyone who attended.

960
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:31,815
We'll have to wrap up here so

961
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,355
we can move to
the next session.

962
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:34,806
So, see you there,

963
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:36,826
and see you also in
the next session.

964
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:38,106
Bye for now.
