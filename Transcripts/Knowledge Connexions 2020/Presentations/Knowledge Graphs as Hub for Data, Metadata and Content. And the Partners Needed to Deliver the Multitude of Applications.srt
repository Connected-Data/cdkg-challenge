00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,015
our good friends, OntoText.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,260
OntoText have been
in this space

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,080
a long time,

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,780
and really looking forward to

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,300
finding out the latest kind of

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,915
direction of the,
the the product that,

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,175
they've they've developed.

10
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:26,355
And I'll be moderating
this session.

11
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,535
Please, say hello,
introduce yourselves,

12
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,455

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,750
we'll cover those
at the end. Great.

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,590
Welcome, Naso and, Vasil,

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,275
and and over to
you. Thank you.

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,655
Thank you very much, James.

19
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,215
It's indeed a great
pleasure to,

20
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,700
yeah, to be to
be again part of

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,840
this conference.

22
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,980
We have fresh
memories from one

23
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,200
year ago in London.

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,735
So, it will be
myself presenting

25
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:00,335
and and OntoTech's,
CTO, Vasil Mamcheff.

26
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,650
So I I I will I will entertain

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,110
you with a bit of
introduction of,

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,250
who we are,

29
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,590
and then I'll share our vision

30
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,385
on on the market for knowledge

31
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:14,585
gap technology and different

32
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:17,005
applications and how,

33
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:20,720
semantic metadata
are the key to put,

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,700
to for quite a number
of different

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,720
applications and
how how they,

36
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,100
can improve both
data management

37
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,140
and content management,

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,500
and and actually put data and

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,565
content together.

40
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,945
Then, I'll hand over to Vasil

41
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:38,440
to share with you, yeah,

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,480
few updates about,

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Onstext platform
and and and our

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,300
database engine, Graph DB,

45
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,735
and to to to basically
walk you through,

46
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:51,835
the different aspects of what

47
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:54,120
it takes to to get
data in a graph

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,480
database, to to
transform them,

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,405
to make a proper
graph out of it,

50
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,565
and then to consume
them either

51
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,325
from whatever tool all the way

52
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:05,665
from BI tool,

53
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,625
that access data
to a JDBC driver

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,140
to another
application that use

55
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,380
use it through, say,

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,320
GraphQL or other APIs.

57
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,720
And then we'll finish off with

58
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,045
an overview of our partner

59
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,025
ecosystem because,

60
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:26,045
with the those wide range of

61
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,505
applications of
these technologies,

62
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,090
there is no single
vendor, at least,

63
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,550
no no no none of these,

64
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,610
specialized technology
providers,

65
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,475
who who can deliver
all the applications

66
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:38,855
to you.

67
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:41,275
So we built a partner
ecosystem,

68
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,155
to to to to be able to,

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
put the right technology stack

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,900
in place and to be able to to

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,980
to also deliver
it at at scale.

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,365
So let's get started
with the introduction

73
00:02:56,465 --> 00:03:00,465
. So on to take this, yeah,

74
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:01,505
we started with,

75
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,345
what was back then
semantic weapon,

76
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:05,330
semantic technology
in year two

77
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,010
thousand. And we
had the chance

78
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,130
to to to be to be
part of the avant

79
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,815
garde in this technology and

80
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:13,275
went to the all the evolution

81
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,275
to link to open
data, nowadays,

82
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:16,235
knowledge gaps.

83
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:21,810
And, well, nowadays,
we are, like,

84
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,030
most of our clients,

85
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,850
are are the total leaders in

86
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,310
different industries
and markets,

87
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,470
like multinational companies.

88
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,725
Still, if we have
to to to come

89
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,385
to where where their
headquarters are,

90
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,945
it's quite an even
split between

91
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:40,910
UK where where we got
our first clients,

92
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,410
big clients in stories
ten years ago,

93
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,685
and, then US has
a growing area,

94
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,145
Asia also, and main,
mainland Europe.

95
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,365
Up until a year ago,

96
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,930
it was easy to say Europe.

97
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,110
Now you gotta say
Europe and UK.

98
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,870
But, anyway so,

99
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:05,415
you see some selection
of our clients.

100
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:09,015
I'll talk a bit more
about the verticals

101
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,240
, But, yeah, you see that most

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
of them are
precisely this type

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,100
of really big enterprises.

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
We we are not
allowed to mention

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,045
some of them,
but that's that's

106
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,005
the way it is.

107
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:24,745
We being being part of this

108
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,425
industry and part of the this

109
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,480
community that is,

110
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,020
developing the trends
and setting

111
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,500
the standards, we we do this

112
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,520
through through
a number of, yeah,

113
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,895
organizations, worldwide web

114
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,635
that we would see,
being the main one,

115
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,635
which not only standardizes

116
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,360
World Wide Web, HTML, HTP,

117
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,340
and all these
standards on which

118
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,880
the World Wide Web is built,

119
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,275
but they are also
the ones that

120
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,215
standardized RDS, Fargo, OWL,

121
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,315
and the stack of,

122
00:04:56,475 --> 00:04:57,835
the stack of standards that we

123
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,540
we build our technology on.

124
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,860
And we have we
had the chance,

125
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,200
and we we are still
very happy to,

126
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,920
to keep pushing
our research to

127
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:08,365
a collaborative project.

128
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,565
So we are we are very,

129
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:11,725
very well interconnected with

130
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,565
those sorts of academic groups

131
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,865
in this field in Europe.

132
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,090
Our best, our most
popular product is,

133
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,310
Onstead's Graph DB.

134
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,570
We're getting, I don't
know, probably,

135
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,685
thousand or a bit
more downloads,

136
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,565
of, Graph DB per month.

137
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:32,145
And, yeah, we have an active

138
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,400
user community of more than

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,020
thirty thousand
deployed instances.

140
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,820
So there are plenty
of statistics

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
like that, and and we're happy

142
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,625
that we also see
recognition among,

143
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:47,245
yeah, different,
market analysts.

144
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:51,140
So, OnSpace GovDB
is seen as as

145
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,900
one one of the one
of the leading

146
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,280
engines in this field.

147
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,540
On top of this engine,

148
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,425
we actually have
a bigger set of,

149
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:02,025
a bigger platform,

150
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:03,945
knowledge graph platform,

151
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:06,155
called you wouldn't
guess it on

152
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,225
the text platform,

153
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,780
which extends what we get out

154
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,640
of Graph DB with,

155
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,440
analytics services
and infrastructure

156
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:15,995
for text analysis,

157
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:17,375
for data quality management,

158
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:18,895
and quite a few other things.

159
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:25,230
So, this platform,
yeah, helps you yeah.

160
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,630
It makes it much easier
to to to deploy,

161
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,970
to to make knowledge
center solutions.

162
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,785
But we'll talk about
the platform,

163
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,325
later on in this
presentation.

164
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:37,285
So stop here. On
the right hand side,

165
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,910
you see, yeah,

166
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,130
a business case or
or or the typical

167
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,690
solutions, that we offer and

168
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,210
that we can customize across

169
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,510
across different industries.

170
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:48,785
Like, historically,

171
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,145
we started with media
and publishing,

172
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:52,805
then we went to
financial services.

173
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,265
Life science and
health care is

174
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,805
a is a strong one too.

175
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,120
So to finish off
with the intro,

176
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,620
what makes us unique is this

177
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,300
combination of the graph graph

178
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,280
database engine,

179
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,865
which is suited for all all

180
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,465
kinds of use cases for for

181
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,365
knowledge graphs.

182
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,545
And the combination of this

183
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,720
database with text analysis,

184
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,080
services and
infrastructure tools,

185
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,680
like curation tools,

186
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,220
and manual
annotation tools and

187
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,425
so on and so forth
that can use

188
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:28,325
and are tuned to
use big knowledge

189
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,985
graphs for, text analysis.

190
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,970
As I said,
the entire portfolio

191
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,150
is based on, the double
two c stack of,

192
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,115
standards. And there is also

193
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,115
what if open source tooling as

194
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:44,535
part of this this
environment.

195
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,515
So the entire front end of our

196
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,070
database engine
is open source.

197
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,190
You can get it for kit,

198
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,730
use it for everything
you want.

199
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,110
Then the the plug in
API is open source.

200
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,530
We are supporter of
one of the leading

201
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,805
open source projects
in this space.

202
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,345
The probably
the biggest supporter

203
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,505
historically, are the four j,

204
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:07,220
also for text
analysis platforms,

205
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,500
and so on and so forth.

206
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
So we had the chance to to to

207
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,495
and I had the chance to gather

208
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,095
a team with a very,
very diverse set of,

209
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:21,415
skills and and
expertise across

210
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,850
different types of technology

211
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,170
and and science and
and verticals.

212
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,550
I'm not going to
list them because

213
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,990
that's not the purpose of this

214
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,730
this presentation.

215
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:35,115
Well, over time,
we realized that,

216
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,735
actually, the biggest
the biggest

217
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,255
asset and the most important

218
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:39,435
thing that we have is this

219
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,120
ecosystem of partners, which,

220
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,400
two years came to trust on to

221
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,560
text technology and work with

222
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
us in in in different ways.

223
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,345
So we have all all sorts of

224
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,045
consultants and OEM partners,

225
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,285
and we partner
with quite a few,

226
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,285
tool providers.

227
00:08:57,305 --> 00:08:58,505
And and many of
these people are

228
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,025
actually present on
this conference.

229
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,030
So Symantecweb
company, MetaFacts,

230
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,030
and and and few others.

231
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,650
So, this was all in terms of

232
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,385
introduction. So
now let's talk

233
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,285
about the market.

234
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,965
If I gotta talk to to
to the investors,

235
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,220
the positive
message is, well,

236
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,880
this market is
doing very well.

237
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,000
If Gartner is saying that it

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,520
will be doubling
for another two

239
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,500
years two years,

240
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,725
That's that's just great.

241
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,985
And if you look at these,

242
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,845
hype cycles and curves,

243
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
you see knowledge graphs are

244
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,020
still still still going up,

245
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
so on the this peak of,

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,460
inflated expectations.

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,225
So, luckily, we're
still getting

248
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:47,665
people to who who are calling

249
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:49,025
us just because
knowledge graphs

250
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:49,605
are hot.

251
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,165
But we also see that,

252
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,050
and and and in this case,

253
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,470
I can agree with
with Gartner.

254
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,550
We see that, this trend,

255
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:03,325
is just about to to, yeah,

256
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:06,185
go go down to the yeah.

257
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,645
What what they
call disillusionment

258
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,210
because, yeah,

259
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,230
what is important
now is to see,

260
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,670
really a mature ways,
mature patterns,

261
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,790
best practices,

262
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,690
and and and tools which can be

263
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,175
used to deliver to
deliver value.

264
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,255
So on the bigger picture,

265
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:27,330
knowledge graphs
are the adoption

266
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,610
of this technology is slower

267
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,930
than what my investors would

268
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,750
want to see,

269
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,710
and probably yours
and and and,

270
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,115
everybody. The
fundamental reason

271
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:39,715
is that, well,

272
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,715
that this technology
is quite complex.

273
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:42,755
If you make it small,

274
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:45,155
if you just convert a piece of

275
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:48,120
data into into RDF,

276
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,420
or you convert the taxonomy in

277
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,325
and represent its
cost, very likely,

278
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,145
you'll you'll not
you'll not be

279
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:58,185
able to deliver on all these

280
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:00,025
promises of all
these knowledge

281
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,010
graph magic does.

282
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,250
So you you you have to use,

283
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,170
and make big knowledge graphs

284
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,930
that can really
provide provide

285
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,940
some context and
allow better better,

286
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,075
interpretation of the data and

287
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,075
bet better, like,

288
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,155
cap better capabilities for

289
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:17,055
linking data.

290
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:19,280
And once we get there, well,

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,220
it's not as as easy.

292
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,360
It takes a while,

293
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,200
a while to do it
to get the right

294
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
tooling and
the infrastructure to do it.

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,515
That's why it's it's,

296
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:30,955
our interpretation,

297
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:32,555
why it's slower
than expected.

298
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:34,775
We we others this by, yeah,

299
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,535
having prepackaged
solutions and

300
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,040
and partnering with,

301
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,600
other vendors who who have

302
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,680
solutions also.

303
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,320
So the short story
here is that,

304
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,420
well, there is no
single techno.

305
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:50,415
It's not a single,
single market.

306
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:52,715
Knowledge graph technology is

307
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,235
in the middle of other number

308
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,195
of different applications.

309
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,680
And, actually,
there is no mature

310
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,220
market for it now
because there

311
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,420
is no critical mass of such

312
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,340
applications. We we gotta make

313
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,980
the applications.

314
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,315
We gotta find our way to to to

315
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:07,455
to the end customers,

316
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,315
to to really
demonstrate the value

317
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:11,295
behind the hype.

318
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,880
And then five years from now,

319
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,160
we we we we we can
expect to see,

320
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,800
a a critical mass
of applications

321
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,525
that generates
a critical level

322
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:24,985
of demand for the technology.

323
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,840
So, it's clear that with all

324
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,920
the diversity of
what's possible

325
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,060
to do with this technology,

326
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
no no no single company of,

327
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
our size can can
deal with it.

328
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,385
Even much bigger
companies cannot

329
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,925
deal with this this scale.

330
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:47,405
So, again, our approach
to this is to,

331
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,810
have a have a ecosystem
of partners,

332
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,150
that can, that have the right

333
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,430
vision for
the specific type of

334
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,495
applications, and and and have

335
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:58,775
the engineering talent to

336
00:12:58,775 --> 00:12:59,675
implement them,

337
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,595
taking into account
all the specifics

338
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,595
and the capacity to deliver.

339
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,720
That's quite often
a combination

340
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,760
of different players.

341
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,820
So, that's, yeah,

342
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,505
our mind map of
knowledge graph

343
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:17,825
applications. So, to to us,

344
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,745
knowledge graph is knowledge

345
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,820
graphs are on
the bigger picture

346
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,120
part of the bigger metadata

347
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,400
management story,

348
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,975
and the applications
go into, yeah,

349
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:30,955
equally between
data management

350
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,015
and content management.

351
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,035
There are plenty of knowledge

352
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:37,440
management tools
which also use

353
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,180
this technology,

354
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
and that's a big part of our

355
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,815
best partners, like,

356
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:46,475
Symantec Web Company
and Synoptica.

357
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:49,335
They are in in part of their

358
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,695
offerings are in the space of

359
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:54,260
enterprise taxonomies,
and and and,

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,540
vocabulary and this
kind of technology,

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,980
this time based
on on on on on,

362
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,755
yeah, knowledge gaps.

363
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:05,635
Quite often, these taxonomies

364
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:06,515
and vocabularies,

365
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,175
they are actually
used for better

366
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,075
content management.

367
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,470
This is
the the the the the applications

368
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,250
that you see on
the right hand side.

369
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,810
That's what Google
calls inside engines.

370
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,225
So so it's it's
all about being

371
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,325
able to do cool
things with content,

372
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,305
to to search, to recommend,

373
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:26,325
to to to re if
you're a publisher,

374
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,910
for instance, to to repackage

375
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,370
it and to to to
better deliver it,

376
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,070
to extract information,

377
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,750
to extract data from it,

378
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:37,315
and so on and so forth.

379
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:43,600
Nowadays, probably
the most, yeah,

380
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,540
the the the most
popular application,

381
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,020
although probably not the most

382
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,020
often delivered one,

383
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,555
is in data management.

384
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,295
So using using
knowledge graphs for,

385
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,615
data integration analytics.

386
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,070
And that's what,

387
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,130
Gartner called data fabrics.

388
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,070
That's that's
the whole story of,

389
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,365
what was the data warehouse in

390
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,465
the past and how you
can use them to,

391
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,645
yeah, do better
better business

392
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,665
intelligence and better
decision making.

393
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,960
Data management is
not just that.

394
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
It's actually much
more than this.

395
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,860
You have, a range of data

396
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,720
governance and cataloging
applications,

397
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:25,425
And quite a a big number of

398
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,445
these projects are are about,

399
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,080
dealing with big, databases,

400
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,540
like master and reference data

401
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,595
management tasks,
so that, yeah,

402
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,275
you can aid improve your

403
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,435
transactional systems either,

404
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,495
like in our case,

405
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:44,715
we we have many projects where

406
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,950
we use big volumes
of reference data,

407
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,750
master data for better text

408
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,770
analysis and content
content analytics.

409
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,125
So you see that, yeah,

410
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,425
the the range of applications

411
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:57,385
is quite different.

412
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,385
Essentially, each of these,

413
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,265
are already some
mature markets.

414
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,160
So, we we we have
to find a way

415
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,940
in which this, technology in

416
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,435
the middle can
contribute to to to,

417
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:16,695
to to making more efficient

418
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:19,415
specific applications
in this market,

419
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,330
and find a way to to, yeah,

420
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,350
gently disrupt them
and and and and,

421
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,375
offer you you you
value there.

422
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,755
So that's enough about it.

423
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,215
So to summarize the role of,

424
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,570
how we see the role
of knowledge graphs,

425
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,950
the main thing is
that they they

426
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,810
they essentially
put it in context,

427
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,290
and and and they do
it in two ways.

428
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,645
One thing is, linking.

429
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,125
So by
interlinking descriptions

430
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,165
of different things,

431
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,440
you you basically
help help help

432
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
different pieces contribute to

433
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,780
each other's description.

434
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,200
And then the other the other

435
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,500
thing is semantic metadata.

436
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,040
So semantic metadata
is is king.

437
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,695
So you you have better formal

438
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:06,135
descriptions of
everything that's

439
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,755
that's in there.
What is that value?

440
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,270
Well, someone gets
better better

441
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,290
insights, better
results, better,

442
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,870
discoveries, through,

443
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,355
through the capability,

444
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,935
by by by being able to have

445
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:28,050
unified view, on
diverse data.

446
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,890
Diverse databases
be being able

447
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,710
to combine,

448
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,150
structured data from
different sources,

449
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,290
being able to also
put in the mix

450
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,475
text documents and
other content.

451
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,055
And, well, quite often,

452
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,535
what we see is that to to get

453
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:45,835
the right level of analytics,

454
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,600
enterprises should combine

455
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,920
proprietary data with publicly

456
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,080
available data, with
with global data,

457
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:54,565
to combine their wisdom and

458
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:56,085
understanding of
the market with

459
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,145
background knowledge,

460
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:59,125
which can serve for better

461
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,225
interpretation. That's
that's what we,

462
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,800
deliver most of the time.

463
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,940
So, we combine, master data,

464
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,140
reference data from different

465
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,600
with the different sources,

466
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,475
what you see on the right hand

467
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:13,915
side in a knowledge graph,

468
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,035
and then we use this knowledge

469
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:16,335
graph to analyze documents.

470
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,255
Analyzing documents,

471
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,435
we produce metadata,

472
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:21,000
which becomes part
of the knowledge

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,940
graph. And this
way, we we put,

474
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,420
different kinds
of databases and

475
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,780
content together.

476
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,455
Obviously, there are plenty of

477
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:32,095
applications, and and benefits

478
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:33,695
of doing this both
on the content

479
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,795
management side and
and data management.

480
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,170
So metadata is king.

481
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,690
Metadata is everything.

482
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,830
If you listen to to Gartner,

483
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,545
metadata is, at
the middle of the,

484
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:50,725
yeah, next generation data

485
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:51,785
integration applications,

486
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:53,705
what they call data fabric.

487
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,140
So it's about
gathering different

488
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,760
types of, metadata,

489
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,340
putting them together,
structuring them,

490
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
interlinking them,
activating them,

491
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,165
and so on.

492
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,065
The important thing to realize

493
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,065
here is
the the diversity that,

494
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:11,340
you everything could be could

495
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,780
be metadata. It could be,

496
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,440
everything from
from the schema

497
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,035
of your your database to all

498
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,975
sorts of catalogs
or taxonomies

499
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:24,215
or reference data, tagging,

500
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:25,575
annotations of content,

501
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,960
operational logs,

502
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,920
and so on and so forth.

503
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,060
So it's really diverse.

504
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
You quite often need several,

505
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,420
many types of
metadata combined

506
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,745
from from different systems to

507
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:39,065
be able to to to
make a flexible

508
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,065
data integration platform or

509
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:41,885
content management.

510
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,810
I'm not going to read and,

511
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,510
through all these,
citations of Gartner.

512
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,125
The baseline is that the only

513
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,205
way to manage
this metadata and

514
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,905
to put it together is
a knowledge graph.

515
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,725
And, it is it is a semantic

516
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,125
knowledge graph.

517
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,610
The semantic approach having

518
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,810
formal descriptions of,

519
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,850
this metadata that
helps you put

520
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,230
data and content together.

521
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,055
So the RDS tech
web technologies

522
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:14,175
allows you to do
all this, in well.

523
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:18,750
And there there are several

524
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,030
features of the standards in

525
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,190
this tech which contribute to

526
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,470
this all the way from having

527
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,370
global identifiers,

528
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,730
which is key for
interoperability.

529
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:28,275
Formal semantics is really

530
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,255
important because,

531
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,515
it it allows sharing
meaning and and,

532
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,615
interpretation
without ambiguities

533
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,670
and and and, basically
enables enables,

534
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,970
much much better analytics and

535
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,070
combining different
analytic techniques.

536
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:47,815
Standardization is, yeah,

537
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,035
someone that everyone in in

538
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:51,315
enterprise data management,

539
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:52,615
enterprise content
management,

540
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,950
needs and wants
unless you want

541
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,410
to stick with
a single vendor.

542
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,830
And, yeah, at
the end of the day,

543
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,245
it's always about quality and

544
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,865
being able to
maintain quality.

545
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:08,005
So, also so all
means for, like,

546
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,845
RDF shapes and
other techniques

547
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:11,545
for validation are
very important.

548
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,940
All these things are missing

549
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
with the property
graph standard.

550
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,280
So, they they do
great great job

551
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,580
for for graph analytics,

552
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:24,425
but there is essentially no

553
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:26,025
standardization, and there is

554
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,145
no notion of semantics.

555
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:29,405
There is even no
notion of schema.

556
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,650
There is no data
schema language.

557
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,630
So it's obvious
that RDF is much

558
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,390
much better suited
for knowledge gaps,

559
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,930
and that's what we hear from,

560
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:41,935
our clients
being predominantly

561
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,095
enterprise date
data architects.

562
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:47,855
We have built the methodology

563
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:51,000
of everything that
that it takes to,

564
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,300
build in a and and
if of knowledge

565
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,760
graph all the way
from requirement

566
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,340
analysis, data gathering,

567
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,960
and so on and so forth to,

568
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:03,635
putting together
semantic data model,

569
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:06,815
integrating the data,

570
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:10,780
reconciling the data,
cleaning the data,

571
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,820
and then being able to store,

572
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,140
index them, enrich them,

573
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,885
make them accessible,
and, unable,

574
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:23,465
updates and be
able to maintain

575
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:24,310
this knowledge graph.

576
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,130
Once once you come
with such a complex

577
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,090
phenomenon, it's,

578
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,270
not a piece of cake to keep it

579
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,710
in good shape and good quality

580
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,855
and be able to make
all the updates

581
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:35,675
that are necessary.

582
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:38,555
So we introduced
the On-tech platform,

583
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,815
which supports
quite quite a big

584
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,035
fraction of this tech.

585
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,010
Everything that is about,

586
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,450
allowing data architects and

587
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,870
everyone who who data
management people,

588
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:54,085
to collaborate with content

589
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:55,365
management people and deliver

590
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:58,325
value for the business
users and

591
00:22:58,325 --> 00:22:59,205
the data scientists,

592
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,000
which are quite
often the consumers

593
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,980
of this technology,

594
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,280
as part of
downstream models or

595
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,360
people who train
specific machine

596
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,815
machine learning,
models on it.

597
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,595
Quite important to all here is

598
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,435
dedicated to to
business analysts

599
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:18,815
and subject matter experts.

600
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,590
So, part part for offering,

601
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,630
is a set of tools
that that allows,

602
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,130
defining APIs and
interfaces and

603
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,185
specifying, views
on this on this,

604
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,105
knowledge graph in the middle

605
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,885
by experts, by
business analysts.

606
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:40,310
So so you don't
don't need a a big

607
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,050
team of,

608
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,250
programmers to to
code middleware.

609
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:46,715
With this,

610
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,515
I'll finish my part
of the presentation.

611
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,720
I want to hand
over to Vasil to

612
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,160
tell you some updates about

613
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,660
the OnText platform
and and Graph DB.

614
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,940
I'll stop sharing
so that Vasil

615
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,300
can take over.

616
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:05,975
Thanks for
the excellent market

617
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:09,080
overview and giving
us all the complexity

618
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,220
of the market of
around the knowledge

619
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,580
graphs and how we can deliver

620
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,720
these type of solutions.

621
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,880
As database provider,

622
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,745
when we meet clients,

623
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:19,765
often we are asked, okay.

624
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,745
I understand the concept of

625
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,285
agreeing cohort
shared identifiers

626
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,960
for classes, instances,

627
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,000
and some predicates,

628
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,220
which identify the meaning of

629
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,160
our organizational data.

630
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,300
But could you tell
me how should

631
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,705
I put the data in Gravity,

632
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:36,665
in your database,

633
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:38,445
and how I should
really develop

634
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:40,205
applications on top of it?

635
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,945
And this is probably the most

636
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,465
frequent question we get from

637
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:45,660
our clients when they expect

638
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,180
really some sort of a mature

639
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,800
tooling around the technology

640
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,600
in order to quickly
develop solutions.

641
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,775
In this my presentation,

642
00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:55,855
I'm going to share five key

643
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:57,315
highlights which has happened

644
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:58,835
this year of twenty twenty,

645
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,030
And these are really the major

646
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,030
developments and
tools we which

647
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,750
we enable our
clients to develop

648
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,065
and partners, of course,

649
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:08,905
to develop faster and better

650
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:09,965
knowledge graph solutions.

651
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:12,505
So the first one
is really the data

652
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:14,025
virtualization,
which gives you

653
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,190
a virtual sparkle
endpoint access

654
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,250
to the different databases.

655
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,670
Then we enable
the mapping with

656
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,070
the mapping new
mapping UI subject

657
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,975
matter export
with no coding to

658
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,735
generate RDF
models around some

659
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,735
skimmers. Then I will speak

660
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,035
about the data
reconciliation,

661
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,715
how you really
need to integrate

662
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,170
multiple datasets,

663
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,990
which speaks about
the same type

664
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,650
of entities.

665
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,730
Then we we go to
the consumption

666
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,470
of the data. Once we
have the knowledge

667
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,455
graph, how you
can let your data

668
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:44,815
scientists and
business analysts

669
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:45,795
to consume the data.

670
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:47,455
And last but not least,

671
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:49,075
I'm going to
introduce the GraphQL

672
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,270
platform, which
gives you a really

673
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,450
fantastic way how
you can design

674
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,690
APIs also for your application

675
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,810
solution developers,

676
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,635
and there is an automatic way

677
00:25:58,635 --> 00:25:59,915
to interact with the knowledge

678
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,335
graph with really
minimal calling.

679
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,795
Okay. First thing first,

680
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:05,615
data virtualization.

681
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Nearly all enterprise data is

682
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,940
still stored in
relational databases,

683
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,855
and there is a good
reason there

684
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:16,875
because these are
transactional systems,

685
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,555
master reference records,

686
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:20,955
where the information
is primarily

687
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:23,170
stored. The most
logical question

688
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,970
is how I can move
the data from

689
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,690
relational databases
into a knowledge

690
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,430
graph, basically.

691
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:32,615
And we give you two
type of use cases.

692
00:26:32,615 --> 00:26:34,555
The first type of use case is

693
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:36,715
I want to make a decorative

694
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,235
transformation of
the relational

695
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,515
database into RDF,

696
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,200
or I want to access
the database

697
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,360
on the file. In
order to enable

698
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,960
this use case, Graphvini nine

699
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,320
dot five integrates
with the on

700
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,605
top framework, which supports

701
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,865
decorative, descriptors like

702
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:54,645
the and the OBDA,

703
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,325
which are part of the On top

704
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,800
project to give
you all the fly

705
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,960
access to a wide range of

706
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,660
relational models
like Postgres,

707
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,180
DRAMU Oracle, MySQL,

708
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,860
Microsoft SQL Server,

709
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,085
really a big range
of technologies.

710
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:11,585
In order the design
decision we

711
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:14,065
took was to expose
every virtual

712
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:16,320
every relational
database as its

713
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,640
own virtual
repository in order

714
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
to make the data locality very

715
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,620
transparent for the users.

716
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,760
This made the users
fully aware

717
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,040
that they are
accessing different

718
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,105
type systems. However,

719
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,785
in order to optimize
the performance,

720
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,305
we implement
the highly efficient

721
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:31,125
internal federation,

722
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,320
where if you federate two

723
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,080
endpoints which are located on

724
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,380
the same CloudDB Server,

725
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,140
you use a highly efficient

726
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,540
internal protocol
for data exchange.

727
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:43,065
The benefit is that you get to

728
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:44,745
this on top integration also

729
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:46,265
integrated with
all the security

730
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,610
features and the the Graph DB

731
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,610
security model,
single sign on,

732
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,990
and all these type
of functionalities.

733
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,950
So the second
feature is really

734
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,910
mapping UI,

735
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:57,945
how you can let your subject

736
00:27:57,945 --> 00:27:59,305
matter experts and the people

737
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,645
knowing the data
without coding

738
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,720
to populate
the knowledge graph.

739
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,180
How many of your organizations

740
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
have most of the critical data

741
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,340
in some sort of
a spreadsheet,

742
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,480
CSV file, or
something which is

743
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,940
used as a reference model?

744
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,265
Using the open refine tool,

745
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:17,785
which is nicely
integrated with

746
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:20,265
open with Graph
DB and Graph DB

747
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,590
Workbench, you
can transform any

748
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,190
type of structure that you are

749
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,230
form of JSON, XML,
CSVs, g files,

750
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,370
whatever you have,

751
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,015
and it gives you an efficient

752
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:33,195
way to clean and
cluster the data.

753
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:34,935
Usually, once you
start with any

754
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:36,955
type of CSV or Excel files,

755
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,100
there is a really
sort some type

756
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,940
of cleaning. This is nicely

757
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,460
integrated with CloudDB so you

758
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,300
can create a project
with the table

759
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,060
of data. On the right side,

760
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,240
you can see the new
mapping interface,

761
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:50,355
which checks what are the word

762
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,655
ontologies in the repository,

763
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:54,035
and it can guide the user what

764
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,715
are the product predicates and

765
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:57,395
the properties sorry,

766
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:59,290
the types to use in order to

767
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,350
generate a mapping,

768
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,450
which is then transformed
into RDF file.

769
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,990
So from this table or data,

770
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,730
you can really record this as

771
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,725
a structure. You you basically

772
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:10,945
say how you
transgenerate the RDA

773
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,465
values and how
these values are

774
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:15,490
connected. As a next step,

775
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,470
it supports two modes.

776
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,830
One is really the interactive

777
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,110
mode where the user can,

778
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:23,465
preview the information,
clean it,

779
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,925
check what we
would the output.

780
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,665
But, also, it
supports the tool

781
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,445
supports to batch everything,

782
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:29,885
to record
the transformations,

783
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,060
and really to
make it sound and

784
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,240
transparent using
a batch script.

785
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,540
Also, the API
supports streaming

786
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,140
data streaming where you can

787
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,095
batch really big
files and process

788
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:41,155
them on demand.

789
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:44,655
The third big
feature is the data

790
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,175
reconciliation, and this is

791
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,295
the case when you have to

792
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:48,915
integrate multiple datasets

793
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,020
sharing the same identifiers.

794
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,240
Once again, our focus is to

795
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,160
subject matter experts and how

796
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,320
without code to
perform the entity

797
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,635
resolution. The
data resolution

798
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:01,395
is the entity resolution is

799
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:03,735
actually matching
entities into

800
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,170
different type of, tables.

801
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,950
And we say this
is a mapping of

802
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,850
string two things.

803
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,250
By using
the graph connectivity

804
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,450
and the schema,

805
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,210
this gives you really a power

806
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:17,995
of subject matter
experts in a stepwise

807
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:19,655
process to say how you can

808
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:20,635
reconcile the data.

809
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:21,495
On your screen,

810
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:23,990
you see some
American US banks,

811
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,810
and the task is really to find

812
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,670
the right ID in dataset,

813
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,830
like QuickiData or whatever.

814
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,555
So why this is
an efficient work

815
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,475
process and it
requires no calling?

816
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,075
Because the subject
matter experts

817
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,995
can start reconciling
the state.

818
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,295
Like you see on the diagram,

819
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
the reconciling the US states

820
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,880
is an easy task because there

821
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,940
is no big community.

822
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
Then you can go to the cities

823
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
by using the state,

824
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,600
which should use the,

825
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,295
in the because the,

826
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,315
cities are connected
to the states.

827
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:53,055
Later on, at the final step,

828
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:54,415
you need to really reconcile

829
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:56,415
the organization
and pick the right

830
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:56,915
organization.

831
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,140
Next, let's imagine that you

832
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,580
have the knowledge
graph and you

833
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,020
passed all the hurdles to put

834
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,915
the data in a knowledge graph

835
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,375
and the RDL databases.

836
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:10,855
But the next
question is, hey.

837
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:13,635
I have a big data
scientist and

838
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:14,935
knowledge engineer team,

839
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,490
and none of them knows Parco.

840
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,330
They're really
good with business

841
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,650
BA type of tools
like Tableau,

842
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,770
Microsoft Power BI.

843
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:27,215
Could you just export
me a spreadsheet

844
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:29,855
and a table in where
I can analyze it?

845
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:31,855
No. This is really a forward

846
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:33,675
approach because if you you'll

847
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:36,160
be replicating data,
which is wrong.

848
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,940
Now browDB comes with
the JDB access,

849
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,660
which enables all
type of tools

850
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,760
which supports JDBC
like Tableau,

851
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,265
Microsoft BI,

852
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,905
to directly interact
with the data

853
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:48,945
and to connect,

854
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,625
investigate what
are the tables.

855
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:52,465
And you can directly visualize

856
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:54,990
and take the data out
of the database.

857
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,050
The way how we do this is we

858
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,970
define SQL views,

859
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,830
which are basically
SPARQL results.

860
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:02,175
In these SPARQL results,

861
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,935
there is a nice user interface

862
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,535
where you put your
SPARQL query,

863
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:07,615
you say what is
the SQL table name,

864
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:08,495
and the interface,

865
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,195
depending on the data
distribution,

866
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,410
guides you how to
use this right

867
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,510
SQL types in order
to get the results.

868
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,625
At the end so below
you see a one

869
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,785
technicality is
that this driver

870
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,705
will also try to push as much

871
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:25,165
as possible of the complexity

872
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:26,525
down to the database.

873
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:28,370
So if you have work logs in

874
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,530
the SQL query,
it will be pushed

875
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,370
down to the sparkle
in order to

876
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,130
minimize the exchange between

877
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,790
the SQL engine and
the RTL database.

878
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:39,685
Last but not least,

879
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,465
this is really
a very big topic.

880
00:32:41,685 --> 00:32:43,865
Autotech invested
in a platform

881
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:44,985
based on GraphQL,

882
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:47,800
how you can really expose how

883
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,480
you can expose
knowledge graphs

884
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,580
and quickly build
and generate APIs.

885
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,280
One of the main challenges is

886
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,520
once you design any
type of a system

887
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,625
is that you need to
plan for the APIs,

888
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:00,525
and these APIs needs to be

889
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:01,805
synchronized with
the scheme of

890
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:02,465
the model.

891
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,790
Now the Graph DB and the now

892
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,390
the auto text
platform can read

893
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,710
the data with using this auto

894
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,770
text platform workbench,

895
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,930
the schema of the of
the graph database,

896
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,135
and automatically
generate the Graph

897
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:15,595
QL API for you.

898
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:17,435
Using this GraphQL API,

899
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,175
you can select what are only

900
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:21,515
the required
permitted operations

901
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,255
in order to control the access

902
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:24,075
to the data.

903
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,620
By for bridging
the GraphQL to RDF,

904
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,600
Autotext develops some really

905
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,925
key features. One
is really a highly

906
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:34,865
efficient graph to
sparkle translation.

907
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:36,765
This seems as an easy task,

908
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,705
but in order to get
the full complexity,

909
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,540
we have tweak the semantic
the semantics

910
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,400
of SPARQL and having a special

911
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,580
execution mode,

912
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,120
which makes this
really efficient.

913
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,125
Also, this is a bidirectional

914
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:50,105
mapping where we're
using mutations,

915
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,485
which can be
also automatically

916
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:53,145
generated. You
can interact with

917
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,845
the data and modify it,

918
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,030
directly from the GraphQL.

919
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,010
This is really
very good if you

920
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,090
have UI applications who need

921
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,850
some which needs some sort of

922
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,505
data validation or
access control,

923
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,465
which is also supported
over the schema.

924
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,060
What's point here is,

925
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,540
this I'm not sure how many of

926
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,060
you are familiar
with the GraphQL

927
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,820
ecosystem, but
there is another

928
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,620
excellent feature,

929
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,160
which is the GraphQL
federation,

930
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,315
which allows
the integration of

931
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,375
third party services.

932
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:25,535
This is a service
level integration

933
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,375
of the acquired data
visualization,

934
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:29,295
but for other type
of services.

935
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,610
Since this is
a very broad topic

936
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,630
and I don't have time
to go in details,

937
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,850
I really invite you to join

938
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,890
the later session,

939
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,125
which will be led
by Jim Rayfield,

940
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,285
our chief solution, Arhite,

941
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:42,945
who can give you in the deep

942
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:44,405
technicalities of GraphQL

943
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:45,910
federation and
knowledge graphs

944
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,670
and how you can control your

945
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,690
knowledge graph
via the GraphQL

946
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,670
APIs and how you
open the spectral

947
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,155
chaos. Okay. Thank you.

948
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:56,555
I give it now back to Naso to

949
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:57,755
continue with the partner

950
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:59,835
ecosystem and how all these

951
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:01,710
tooling and key features we

952
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,630
develop as
a successful business

953
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,330
model using our partners.

954
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,570
Thank you, Vasil.

955
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,645
Although, yeah,

956
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:11,885
we we we have a very capable

957
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:13,405
database engine, and we have,

958
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,565
a platform on top of it that

959
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,905
that provides a lot
of infrastructure

960
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:18,545
and technology,

961
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,660
we still cannot
cover everything

962
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,860
that you may want to do with

963
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,860
the knowledge graph, and,

964
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,080
before start speaking
of applications.

965
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,805
So, to address this, we have,

966
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,885
a range of portfolio
partners,

967
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,330
which are companies
like Symantec

968
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,430
Web Company,
Synaptica, MetaFacts,

969
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,265
the sensor, Omni,
Memotix, Workbench,

970
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:49,285
quite a number of partners who

971
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,065
provide tools and platforms

972
00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:53,465
which integrate Graph DB.

973
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,310
And and and, this way,

974
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,170
we complement each
other's portfolio,

975
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,710
and we can much
better add the the

976
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,325
full stack of needs
for this technology.

977
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:07,545
Beyond that,

978
00:36:07,945 --> 00:36:10,445
we we we work
quite a lot with,

979
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,600
different kind of
consulting partners.

980
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,180
So we work with,
some of the biggest,

981
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,960
IT service,
providers and system

982
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,205
integrators on Earth.

983
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:21,965
On the list there,
you have, like,

984
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,905
Infosys, WIPO,
Auto SentiData,

985
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,525
Fujitsu. These are
five of the top

986
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:28,365
ten biggest IT
services companies,

987
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:30,950
and, they they
are familiar with

988
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,550
the technology and and and

989
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,310
delivery to to to big clients

990
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,750
all the way from government to

991
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,050
to pharma and back.

992
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:42,035
We also have, much, yes,

993
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:42,855
more specialized,

994
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,095
let's call them
boutique consulting

995
00:36:45,475 --> 00:36:48,170
and delivery partners, like,

996
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,950
data language in in UK and

997
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,725
enterprise knowledge
in in US,

999
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,145
and and and many others.

1000
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:01,725
So, this is an ecosystem that

1001
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:04,770
currently consists
of more than

1002
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,750
fifty partners.

1003
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,950
So, we will not try
to list all of them,

1004
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,725
and we took care to to to put

1005
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:14,585
it right on for all kinds of,

1006
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:16,605
agreements to to make to make

1007
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:18,865
this ecosystem
operate, properly.

1008
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,330
So, yeah,

1009
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,090
we're looking forward to join

1010
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,470
other partners to complement

1011
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,510
the even further,

1012
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,995
the ecosystem with either

1013
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:29,615
consulting delivery skills,

1014
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:32,575
either a a a, yeah, tools.

1015
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:35,610
And this this good point,

1016
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,870
to to invite you
to the webinar.

1017
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,910
Vasu, if you can go
to the next slide.

1018
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,770
The the the the webinar that,

1019
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,965
will take place in
twenty minutes.

1020
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:47,645
That's part of
the promotion to

1021
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,325
party eight of our partner,

1022
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:50,385
Semantic Web Company.

1023
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:55,050
You see that Vasil
is having a very

1024
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,190
intensive day today.

1025
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,930
So he'll finish here,

1026
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,130
and he'll be part of,

1027
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,530
the webinar that
starts in twenty

1028
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,035
minute with minutes
with Pu party eight.

1029
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:11,015
So, it will be it
will essentially

1030
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:12,440
show how, yeah, yeah,

1031
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,960
the integration between pool

1032
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,640
party eight and
and and and and

1033
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,360
Gravity makes pool party much

1034
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,560
better performant and,

1035
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,175
improves on on
the scalability side.

1036
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,535
And we also
demonstrate, Vasil,

1037
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:26,895
I think you gotta press next

1038
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:28,435
because there is
some animation.

1039
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,995
Okay. Part of this
demo will be,

1040
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,390
well, we have a we
we we have a,

1041
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,950
new stacking
service scope now,

1042
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,930
and it works with
giant technology

1043
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,195
graph derived from
Wikidata, geo names,

1044
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,255
Wikipedia, whatever.

1045
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:45,455
And we use it to
analyze news articles.

1046
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:48,860
So part of this
service will be

1047
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,720
a demonstration
of how you can,

1048
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,200
tune the performance,

1049
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,460
the the the the behavior
of this,

1050
00:38:58,265 --> 00:39:02,185
very sophisticated natural

1051
00:39:02,185 --> 00:39:03,645
language processing
text analysis

1052
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:05,520
pipeline by,

1053
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,580
doing small
corrections to this

1054
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,020
knowledge graph
with pool party

1055
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,620
eight and immediately see

1056
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,660
improvement of results.

1057
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,280
In this way, we we show how

1058
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,335
voice management
and tailor made

1059
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:17,115
vocabularies, and and,

1060
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,230
expert work can
can can combine

1061
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,250
and can deliver
value in combination

1062
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,990
with very big
knowledge graphs.

1063
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,510
So it's it's
a work with them.

1064
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,945
We've been and we're I've been

1065
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:30,625
working half half life to make

1066
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,625
this possible,
so you you still

1067
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,885
have a chance to join
in twenty minutes.

1068
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,760
And that's just one
of our partners.

1069
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,220
We are very happy with our
